                        <p>Hey, there&#8217;s no pre-credits gag again!  The fuck&#8217;s goin&#8217; on &#8217;round here?</p>
<p>The episode begins with Michelle&#8217;s Flintstones-themed birthday party in full effect.  Damn, when they said they had to get the decorations together at the end of part 1, they were not fucking around.  This shit is elaborate!  The best part is when it&#8217;s explained that Danny got all of the props and costumes from the tv station where he works.  Well, alright.  I would never have assumed that he bought all that shit from a party store, but a tv station having an elaborate collection of real-life Flintstones sets and costumes makes perfect sense.  Thanks for clearing that up.</p>

It really makes me miss having health insurance.  But who cares about that, the real issue is that Jesse being a terrible, terrible, unbelievably shitty husband has just reached a new height, to such a startling degree that it could have never been foreseen.  This fucking guy just could not let his wife have a baby without causing a bunch of problems and making it all about himself.  He couldn&#8217;t just stand in a room.  That&#8217;s all he had to do.  Just stand in the room, you greasy, unemployed fuck.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, back at the full house, Joey and the girls scramble to send all the party guests home so they can attempt to fill the cavernous pit of non-support that Jesse has created at the hospital.  The children are all instructed to open up the present they&#8217;ve brought and present it to Michelle and then she walks down the line and ranks each gift.  And that, my friends, is the end of Michelle&#8217;s birthday party.</p>
