                        <p>Big Shout-outs to FHR&#8217;s 700th Facebook fan, Michael Robertson.  Your reward is the public humiliation of being called out as a fan on this blog.  If you&#8217;re not a fan of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Full-House-Reviewed/116296178418358">FHR on Facebook</a> then you better get with the program.  There&#8217;s some pretty neat stuff going on over there.</p>
<p>Pre-Credits Gag:  Ok, see, the pre-credits gag is back again!  Can anyone tell me what&#8217;s up with this?  I&#8217;m baffled.  Anyway, in this one, DJ tries to teach Michelle how to crack eggs into a bowl.  After DJ&#8217;s explanation, Michelle says, &#8220;Duh,&#8221; cracks an egg, and then throws the egg shell into the bowl and stirs it in.  What&#8217;s her fucking problem?  Maybe she&#8217;s regressing because of the new babies or something.  Oh, wait, never mind.  She was always an asshole.</p>

<p>Jesse goes on a whole ramble about the babies being recognized as individuals and it&#8217;s clarified that the babies are currently being identified by their medical bracelets, plus one of them burps a lot and the other one apparently likes Elvis, or at least Jesse seems to think so because he&#8217;s actually incapable of empathizing with any other human beings, much less recognizing them as individuals, and so he merely projected himself onto his child.  The gang decide to take pictures of the babies to send to all of the grandparents that they never have on the show anymore and then Becky busts out booties that her mom made for the babies.  Jesse sees the booties and decides that they&#8217;d draw too much attention to the fact that the full house is filled with the most conspicuously closeted gay men in all of San Francisco.  When Jesse tells Becky that he doesn&#8217;t want the babies to wear the booties, she starts crying again because women are crazy, you guys, and should just stay in the kitchen, plus also have high paying jobs.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a pretty lengthy scene of Danny hosting Wake Up, San Francisco by himself and I can&#8217;t tell if we&#8217;re supposed to know that he&#8217;s terrible at it or not.  After the show wraps, Mr. Strowbridge shows up, who we haven&#8217;t seen in like 2 Seasons or something.  I wonder where he&#8217;s been.  Anyway, he tells Danny that he needs a temporary replacement for Becky while she&#8217;s taking time off to take care of her babies with no help from her useless husband.  Danny says he doesn&#8217;t want a temporary co-host but then Mr. Strowbridge tells him that he&#8217;s already hired one and she starts tomorrow, which might seem kind of abrupt but that&#8217;s actually how every decision has been made about Wake up, San Francisco for the entire series.  Mr. Strowbridge introduces Danny to Vicky Larson, the new co-host, and then Danny immediately decides that he wants to fuck her so he starts acting like a real pompous asshole.</p>

<p>Jesse tries to wake up before Becky so he can figure out a way to identify the babies.  He treads water aimlessly until Becky wakes up and notices that the baby who doesn&#8217;t usually burp is burping.  She leaves the room to go take a shit and then Jesse decides that the babies must be switched and frantically tries to switch their places before Becky gets back.</p>
<p>After switching the babies, Jesse realizes that he still doesn&#8217;t know which is which and then he asks Becky what she would do, hypothetically, if the babies got mixed up, which of course stirs up her unstable female emotions.  The scene is interrupted by Michelle, who just walks into their room without knocking or anything and asks again if she can hold one of the babies.  Jesse&#8217;s like, fuck it, and decides that if he can&#8217;t even identify his babies then he must not value their lives very much, and offers one of them to Michelle.  Surprisingly, she does not kill the baby.  Unsurprisingly, the audience totally jizzes in their pants over this unabashedly saccharine nonsense.  They&#8217;ve already been going &#8220;aww&#8221; pretty much anytime there&#8217;s a close-up of either of the babies, but when Michelle kisses the baby and tells him that she loves him, they fucking lose their shit.</p>

<p>Even still, you can tell by the look in that baby&#8217;s eyes that it knows that there&#8217;s a really good chance that it&#8217;s about to get murdered.</p>
<p>Right before they begin taping their first episode of Wake Up, San Francisco together, Danny gets all intimidated because he finds out that Vicky has all these tv credentials, which he would have found out earlier if he&#8217;d just shut the fuck up for 2 seconds.  Danny and Vicky have some really forced on-air tension and then they bring out their first guest, Joey, because why not?  Joey comes out in his Ranger Joe gear and performs some remarkably improved ventriloquism, which I was almost impressed by before realizing that Mr. Woodchuck&#8217;s dialogue was pre-recorded.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, back at the full house, Jesse confides in the girls that he&#8217;s gotten the babies mixed up and uses their junior detective kit to take one of the baby&#8217;s footprints so he can compare it to their birth certificate to identify them.  While Jesse takes one of the babies footprints, Becky shows up and wants to know what the fuck&#8217;s going on.  Jesse tries to  hide what he&#8217;s doing but doesn&#8217;t think to cover up the baby&#8217;s inky foot with the booties for some reason, and instead puts the baby&#8217;s foot in his pocket.  Although I&#8217;m going to totally hate myself for admitting this, and it definitely made me concerned for that baby actor&#8217;s safety, I actually laughed a little at the baby-foot-in-pocket routine.  It&#8217;s just such an absurd image.  I know, I probably lost like 100 readers for giving this show some credit even one time, but that&#8217;s like 2 things I ever thought of as funny over the course of over 100 episodes, and this is the first time it didn&#8217;t involve a cast member getting hurt.  Even still, I&#8217;m deeply ashamed.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s up with these new babies?  The original baby had to be played by twins due to child labor laws or something, so how&#8217;d they get these guys on here?  I&#8217;m pretty sure that they&#8217;re not played by quadruplets.  I always wondered if the new twins were supposed to be some sort of show of baby-wrangling prowess, like they were so experienced with having babies on the show that they knew they could pull it off or something.  Or maybe the show was a big enough hit that they could get away with violating all sorts of child-labor conventions?  Maybe one of you readers can shed a little light on the subject, and if not, that&#8217;s fine, too, because who cares?</p>
