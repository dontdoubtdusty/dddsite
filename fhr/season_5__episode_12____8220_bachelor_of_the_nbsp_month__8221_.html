                        <h1>Season 5, Episode 12, &#8220;Bachelor of the&nbsp;Month&#8221;</h1>
                        <p><em>Original Date: 2012-05-04</em></p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Well, shit.  There&#8217;s no pre-credits gag again.  I&#8217;m not even gonna acknowledge it anymore when this happens.  I&#8217;m just totally over it.</p>
<p>Jesse comes downstairs as the rest of the family eats breakfast and then Danny and Joey totally guilt trip him about how he hasn&#8217;t been spending time with them because he has two brand new babies.  Jesse ignores their feelings, as he always does with everyone&#8217;s, and then he goes on a whole thing about what an awesome dad he is.</p>
<p>Vicky comes by to pick Danny up for work and then the girls all start talking to her about how bad their dad wants to fuck her.  Just as Vicky tries to break it gently to Danny that he&#8217;s horrendously unappealing, Kimmie Gibbler comes in through the back door and busts out a spread in Bay City magazine that&#8217;s declared Danny &#8220;Bachelor of the Month.&#8221;  Say Whaaat?!!?</p>

<p>Jesse and Becky show the twins their newly finished room and then there&#8217;s a long boring scene of them being parents.  There&#8217;s an Elvis mobile and a bunch of close ups of the babies not doing anything that make the audience all go &#8220;aww&#8221; for some reason, and that&#8217;s about it.</p>

Since such a statement has to be seen to be believed, there&#8217;s a montage:</p>

Danny-getting-hella-pussy montage, set to none other than ZZ Top (the pussy-gettin&#8217;-est of all musics), they cut to Danny bragging about said pussy on Wake Up, San Francisco.  Vicky asks him to please shut the fuck up because he&#8217;s disgusting and also he might want to actually start talking about shit that people want to hear about on his morning show.  Danny disregards both Vicky and his audience by getting into a pissy argument with her about their dating lives that climaxes with him sort of aggressively coercing her to go out on a date with him.  Although she should totally sue him for pulling some shit like that, she agrees to go on the date under the pretense that she&#8217;ll tell the viewers how shitty it was afterwards.</p>
<p>After Joey takes yet another message from a strange and desperate woman who wants to bang Danny, he asks Jesse how Danny is able to keep track of all of this newfound pussy.  Jesse recounts his methods of organizing all the pussy he got back in the day and then, naturally, Becky comes up behind him and gets all pissed.  Joey points out how exhausted and horrible looking they both are and then they head back upstairs to tend to their unholy spawn.</p>
<p>Danny tells Michelle a bedtime story that&#8217;s all about how he&#8217;s gonna fuck Vicky later and then all of a sudden Teddy walks in.  This is about as clever a reveal as you&#8217;re ever going to see on this show, as it becomes apparent that Danny and Michelle are simulating the tucking-in process hours ahead of time since Danny&#8217;ll be balls deep in Vicky&#8217;s roofied vagina by the time Michelle&#8217;s actual bedtime rolls around.</p>

<p>Joey and the girls make a special dinner for Jesse and Becky and offer to watch the babies for the evening.  I was pretty astonished at this display of selfless behavior, which I suppose could only ever occur for the sake of a corny set-up.</p>

Finally, there&#8217;s a hilarious reveal of Becky and Jesse spending their romantic dinner together sleeping.  Oh, new parents!</p>
