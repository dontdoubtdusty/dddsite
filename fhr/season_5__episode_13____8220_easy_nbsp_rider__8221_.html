                        <p>Pre-Credits Gag:  Yeah, I know.  Anyhow, Joey gets all pissed about a call that&#8217;s made while he plays baseball in the backyard with the girls.  After a shouting match, he quits the game, but is then coerced into staying when he threatens to take his ball and bat with him.</p>

have been better if the bushes were full of knives, or if she was ripped apart by wolves after she fell in the bushes, or if Joey committed suicide after she fell in the bushes, but I guess I&#8217;ll take what I can get.  And I know that that&#8217;s probably a dwarf stunt double, but, hey, I&#8217;m willing to suspend disbelief a little in this scenario.  I&#8217;ll tell you one thing, tho.  After Michelle falls in those bushes, she FLIPS THE FUCK OUT!</p>

<p>Danny and Vicky continue to work together, struggling desperately to ignore their raging boners. They finally address what&#8217;s happening and agree that they shouldn&#8217;t get into a relationship because they work together, and then Vicky says, &#8220;and who knows where I&#8217;ll be after Becky comes back to Wake Up, San Francisco,&#8221; and then there&#8217;s a little pause, which is clearly Vicky putting the idea into Danny&#8217;s head that they have to kill Becky.  Maybe Vicky won&#8217;t be a completely 1-deminsional character after all.  Anyway, as soon as they agree not to do the nasty, they immediately contradict themselves by furiously making out on the couch, with heavy petting and everything.</p>

<p>Anyway, Danny and Vicky finally agree after one episode and no character development to begin a sexual relationship and he decides to give her a little preview of what to expect from it by taking her out for vanilla frozen yogurt.</p>

<p>Jesse and Becky spent that entire episode packing for a car ride.  Seriously.  Deathly boring.</p>
<p>DJ and Stephanie try to trick Michelle into learning how to ride her bike by convincing her that they just want a photo of her sitting on it but she figures out what they&#8217;re doing and gets all pissed.  Joey intervenes and tries to bribe her into learning with a VHS copy of The Little Mermaid, but even that cinematic masterpiece isn&#8217;t enough to persuade her.  Joey finds himself at a loss until the music comes on.  That sweet, mood altering music.  Joey says some inspiring words about keeping at something even when it&#8217;s hard and Michelle is finally manipulated into giving riding a bicycle another shot.</p>
<p>So then they go back to the park and she rides her stupid bike and doesn&#8217;t even get hurt this time.  Joey congratulates her for doing it all by herself and then there&#8217;s this really creepy close-up of her saying, &#8220;uh-uh, Joey, I did it with you.&#8221;  I don&#8217;t know why exactly but that shit gave me hives.</p>
