<p>Pre-Credits Gag:  Becky and Jesse pit the twins against each other in a speed burping match but then the old baby, Michelle, comes in and beats them both.</p>
<p>Becky prepares the twins for a trip to Aunt Ida&#8217;s, a character who didn&#8217;t exist before the previous episode but was such a hit that they had to at least reference her right away.  Meanwhile, the dads all gear up for a hockey game because they want to hang out like old times before Aunt Becky showed up and spoiled their sausage party.  I just realized how much less gay things have been in the full house lately, and it made me sad.</p>

Anyway, Steve explains that he sent a note about their date but it wasn&#8217;t delivered by one of their friends, but he still wants to take her to the back row of the movies for some serious finger-banging.  DJ recognizes that this is probably her only chance ever to finally get some action so she scrambles to figure out what to do with her two ugly sisters.</p>
<p>DJ tells the girls that they have to come with her on the date and Michelle immediately starts giving her a real shitty attitude.  What is it with this fucking kid?  Everything she says is so laced with hostility.  She&#8217;s constantly jutting her face out and making cutty ass remarks, and yet, no one ever gets pissed at her.</p>
<p>DJ eventually convinces her sisters to come along but then further complication arise when Steve wants to see a PG movie.  I&#8217;m not even kidding, Stephanie totally refuses to go to a PG movie and forces them to find something with a G rating instead.  Luckily for DJ, Steve is pretty unphased by this, as he&#8217;s pretty indifferent about what the movie is, just so long as he&#8217;s finger-banging DJ the whole time.</p>
<p>Things get even more complicated at the theater as Stephanie and Michelle somehow figure out a way to spend all of their money at the concessions stand before they buy the movie tickets.  How is that even possible?  You can&#8217;t get to the concessions stand if you don&#8217;t have a ticket.  And even if it was possible, why did DJ give them all of the money she had?  Bringing this string of convenience-based, logic-free story elements to a climax is the sudden revelation that, hey, why the fuck not?  Kimmie Gibbler works at this theater.</p>

<p>DJ makes her sisters sit behind her and Steve inside the theater, which is totally inopportune for finger-banging.  The girls immediately start being loud, obnoxious assholes inside of the theater so DJ moves them to the back row.  Immediately after their relocation, some creepy guy comes up and starts talking to them and for a second I thought this was going to turn into a very special episode but he&#8217;s actually an usher checking people&#8217;s ticket stubs, which totally happens all the time at the movies.</p>

<p>Stephanie totally narc&#8217;s on Kimmie Gibbler when the usher guy takes them into some sort of an office for questioning.  DJ quickly shows up and concocts and elaborate story about the girls being notorious for sneaking into the movies and she lets the usher/manager guy know that she&#8217;ll be alerting their parents as she whisks them off.</p>

<p>The dads all come home and get into a heated argument about how bad they sucked at ice hockey.  Their rage soon turns to lust, and shortly thereafter Aunt Becky walks through the door to discover them all writhing in a pile on the floor.  Oh, glory be!  The overt homosexuality makes a triumphant return!</p>
