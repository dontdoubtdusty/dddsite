<p>The next scene shows us what a good house-husband Jesse is with a rare, on-location segment of him and the girls at the grocery store.  While Jesse stocks up on Elvis peanut butter, another house-husband comes up to him and says that he saw him on the show earlier in the day and wants to commend him for speaking out for himself and all the other husbands out there who have no dick.  Jesse tries to salvage some pride by saying that he&#8217;s actually a musician but the other house-husband just smiles and says that he, too, has loser ambitions.</p>

<p>As Jesse finishes preparing a delightful meal back at the full house, each member of the family gives him some reason why they can&#8217;t sit down for dinner.  Jesse is eventually left alone with Michelle, who he laments to about the state of his life as a failed musician slash pussy ass stay at home dad.</p>
<p>Later, Jesse sits in the living room and talks shit to Joey&#8217;s Mr. Woodchuck puppet until Danny and Becky come home.  Without even saying hello, Danny immediately starts whining to Jesse about how fucked up he is over Vicky leaving.  After Danny wanders off, Jesse tells Becky that he&#8217;s got to go out because he got a gig performing with an oldies group at the airport lounge.  Becky manages to overcome her total astonishment at Jesse finding any kind of employment and instead points out that she wants to hang out with him after she gets home from work and also he doesn&#8217;t need a job because she makes hella money, plus they live in a shitty attic in his brother-in-laws house.  Jesse gets all irate and farts out a bunch of machismo before stomping off to his shitty gig at the airport.</p>
<p>Stephanie attempts to wash the mustard stain out of DJ&#8217;s sweater and shrinks it dramatically in the process.  DJ notices Michelle wearing it and Stephanie is forced to confess.  It turns out that the sweater was borrowed from Kimmie Gibbler, so DJ doesn&#8217;t even give a shit that it&#8217;s ruined, but Kimmie Gibbler demands that Stephanie give her a pedicure as reparations, at which point all the girls flee in terror.</p>
