                        <p>Pre-Credits Gag:  Michelle ruins Stephanie&#8217;s birthday cake because she wants to lick frosting off of the spatula.  Why are all the jokes based around her doing things that children should be discouraged from doing?</p>

<p>Stephanie comes downstairs and gets all up Danny&#8217;s ass about him letting her meet her favorite rock star, Tommy Page, who will be appearing on Wake Up, San Francisco that day, which also happens to be her 10th birthday.  Danny tells her tough shit and sends her off to school, but once she&#8217;s gone he discloses to DJ that Tommy Page will actually be making an appearance at Stephanie&#8217;s birthday party that afternoon.</p>

isn&#8217;t an ending to the sequence or anything, it just cuts abruptly to Danny in the kitchen.  It just struck me as odd to whip out such an elaborate sequence and then just sort of shoo it away, but who cares, I guess.</p>
<p>So then Danny gets Tommy Page to come out and serenade Stephanie.  I honestly had no idea who the fuck this guy was and assumed they got some cheap actor to pretend to be some made up singer, but according to the internet he&#8217;s a real guy.  Anyway, he sings to Stephanie for several minutes while she sighs and the rest of the girls sway back and forth, killing several minutes of action that I&#8217;d otherwise feel obliged to describe.</p>

<p>DJ and Tommy Page&#8217;s inappropriate chemistry is cut short by Stephanie, who asks Tommy Page to sign her CD.  He signs it, &#8220;Love, Tommy&#8221; before kissing her right on the mouth.  Seriously, what&#8217;s wrong with this guy?</p>

<p>After Tommy Page finishes recording the song that he sang to Stephanie (seriously, aren&#8217;t signed musicians not allowed to do stuff like that?  Also, does Danny have photos of him murdering a prostitute or something?  Why doesn&#8217;t he have anything better to do?), the red light turns off and DJ comes rushing downstairs.  Just when DJ&#8217;s ready to start grinding on Tommy Page, Stephanie follows after her and starts showing him embarrassing baby photos of DJ.</p>
<p>DJ pulls Stephanie up to the kitchen and they start having this great bitch-you-stole-my-man argument.  Things get pretty heated and then all the dads come together to try to figure out what the fuck is going on.</p>
<p>Once the fight is broken up, Stephanie goes on this long rant about how she and Tommy Page are in love.  The dads calmly explain to her that what she&#8217;s saying is fucking crazy and her stupid little girl feelings are ridiculous.</p>

<p>Tommy Page apprehensively comes up the stairs and is coerced into telling DJ and Stephanie that he likes them only as friends.  Why aren&#8217;t any of the dads murdering this man?  Ok, I get that he just sang Stephanie a song for her birthday and there&#8217;s no reason why she should have gotten all worked up, but he straight up took DJ out on a date and then kissed her on the mouth.  What was she supposed to think?  It&#8217;s also creepy how professionally he&#8217;s able to tell these young girls that he only likes them as friends, like he goes around kissing young girls on the mouth all the time and then weaseling out of it.  The best part is at the end, where he says, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to cause any trouble.  I hope you&#8217;ll still come to my concert tonight.&#8221;  Spoken like a true professional.</p>
