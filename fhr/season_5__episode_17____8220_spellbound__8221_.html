<p>Danny tries to help Michelle learn how to read by associating letters with cleaning products.  I wonder how often Danny makes his children wash their hands.  I&#8217;d like to see a very special episode about it.  Anyway, Stephanie interrupts their educational session by coming in and freaking out about the spelling bee.  Danny tells her to chill the fuck out and teaches her how to use mnemonic devices to remember how to spell certain words. Dang, that&#8217;s gotta be the most competent parenting that we&#8217;ve ever seen on this show.</p>

<p>So, as if it&#8217;s not already awesome enough to see Stephanie totally fail, she completely flips her shit right afterwards.  She pleads like a heroine addict for another shot at the spelling bee in front of an entire auditorium full of people until the judge finally tells her to get the fuck off the stage.  What a glorious display of indignity!</p>
<p>Bringing this embarrassing spectacle to a climax, Stephanie straight up rushes the stage and tries to spell the next kid&#8217;s word, so the dads have to pull her off stage.  I have to say that Stephanie reacting this way is totally not surprising.  She gets away with that shit all the time in the full house.  Maybe if she got some constructive discouragement at home she wouldn&#8217;t act like that in public.</p>

<p>Jesse writes another Ranger Joe cartoon intro song and once again the audience loses their shit and once again Joey doesn&#8217;t like it.  Finally, Joey decides that he likes a boinging sound that Jesse makes on his keyboard and then they argue over whether or not Jesse should be paid for it.</p>
<p>Jesse comes across Michelle declaring that she&#8217;s giving up reading because she&#8217;s too dumb and he gives her an inspiring speech about what a dumb ass moron he used to be before he started applying himself.  They then go through a really long and boring little-kid-reading-lesson that doesn&#8217;t even have any jokes in it.  Well, anyway, I guess Michelle can read now.</p>
