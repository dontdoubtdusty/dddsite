<p>Michelle asks Ginger if she can do a monkey face and then tries to do one herself.  Bitch, every face you make&#8217;s a monkey face!</p>

<p>Stephanie opens a package that arrived at the house for &#8220;Tanner&#8221; and finds an African statue inside with a note that says that if it isn&#8217;t fed it will curse the house.  Suddenly, DJ and Kimmie Gibbler enter the room and say that they&#8217;re going to be in the bathroom doing beauty makeovers for the next 3 hours, then they leave as quickly as they came in.  Stephanie and Michelle continue to investigate the statue and then its eyes light up and it says, &#8220;feed me,&#8221; which frightens them.</p>

Danny tells Wendy to go take a nap up in his room and then when he gets Joey alone he&#8217;s like, &#8220;back the fuck up off my sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anyway, the monkey runs loose in the house while Joey and Danny look for her and argue.  DJ and Kimmie Gibbler are visited by the monkey, who starts messing with Kimmie Gibbler&#8217;s hair dye just as DJ explains how careful she was when she mixed it.</p>

<p>Oh, I get it!  It was a set-up!  Jesse gets in bed and then lies motionless on his side with his eyes closed, which is how all men present themselves when they want some sex, and then the monkey crawls into bed with him.  Naturally, Jesse never opens his eyes or turns around, and he can&#8217;t tell the difference between his wife&#8217;s touch and a monkey&#8217;s. Instead he is lovingly fondled and even spanked by a monkey for several minutes while Becky watches.</p>

<p>Jesse comes into the room in a robe because he just finished banging his wife and then the Monkey touches him some more and that&#8217;s the end.  So, wait, is Danny&#8217;s sister ever going to be on the show again?  I certainly don&#8217;t remember ever seeing her.  Finally, and in conclusion, I will say that even knowing what I know from watching so many shitty episodes of this terrible show, I still can&#8217;t believe they had an episode about a monkey running loose in the house.</p>
<p>Firsts:  Danny&#8217;s sister Wendy, Ginger the monkey, Joey grows a penis and balls, exterior shot of the tree outside Stephanie&#8217;s window</p>
