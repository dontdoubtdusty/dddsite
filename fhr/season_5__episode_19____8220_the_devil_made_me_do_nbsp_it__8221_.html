<p>Meanwhile, DJ tells Stephanie and Kimmie Gibbler that she&#8217;s hella sick of them fighting all the time, so she locks the 3 of them in her room and says that nobody&#8217;s leaving until they work that shit out.</p>

It also doesn&#8217;t help much that the Olsen twins are fucking terrible actresses.  If they can&#8217;t even do a halfway decent job of playing a regular little kid, why did they even try to get them to do something else?  Michelle&#8217;s good side dresses like a hippy and tells her not to do bad things and the evil one dresses like Little Steven from the E Street band and acts like a condescending asshole, which isn&#8217;t really very much different from how Michelle acts most of the time anyway.  Unsurprisingly, evil prevails and Michelle starts fucking around with Jesse&#8217;s equipment.</p>

<p>Continuing once again the thread of Jesse and Becky being the most boring parents of all time, they film one of the babies eating his first solid food.  Jesse has a hard time refraining from pointing the camera at himself, which seems like a pretty obnoxious thing to do until you have to watch a bunch of disgusting close-ups of the baby trying to eat mashed up bananas.</p>

<p>DJ forces Stephanie and Kimmie Gibbler to find some common ground and they finally bond over complaining about what a pain in the ass DJ is.</p>

<p>Back at the full house, Jesse has a very special talk with Michelle about how dangerous it is to run away from home.  The music comes on as he tells her that it&#8217;s important to follow the rules and then they tell each other that they love one another and then, hugs.</p>
