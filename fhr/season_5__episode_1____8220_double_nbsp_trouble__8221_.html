And so begins Season 5.</p>
<p>Jesse returns home from his summer tour at 3 am and runs up the stairs, loudly announcing his arrival to the denizens of the full house.  Everyone&#8217;s pretty annoyed that he&#8217;s woken them up and fail to conjure up an enthusiastic greeting, which is a rare instance in which someone&#8217;s pushy, inconsiderate behavior is met with anything resembling a realistic response.  Unperturbed, he decides to head up to his attic apartment to bother his wife instead.</p>

<p>In the morning, DJ comes downstairs and asks Danny to evaluate the outfit she&#8217;s chosen for her first day of high school.  After some prodding, he tells her that she looks &#8220;sexy,&#8221; which is almost as disturbing as the image of Joey standing in Michelle&#8217;s doorway.</p>

<p>A rarely used on-location shot shows us Stephanie and Michelle&#8217;s school as Danny and Joey drop them off.  Michelle continues to express her concerns over starting kindergarten throughout the scene and I almost expected them to cave in and let her do whatever she wants like they have in every other circumstance in the entire series, but they actually stick to their guns.  The dads walk Michelle to her class and as they meet her teacher they really do seem an awful lot like a gay couple.  Danny doesn&#8217;t provide any context whatsoever as to who Joey is and even has his arm around him when they exit.  Anyway, before he leaves, Joey reminds Michelle to talk like an annoying asshole as a way to make friends but then, inevitably, the first kid she tries this out on thinks she&#8217;s a fucking weirdo.  Seriously, what&#8217;d she think was gonna happen?  By this point, anyone who takes advice from Joey should blame themselves for what happens afterwards.</p>

<p>Even at the doctor&#8217;s office, Jesse continues to make dickhead remarks about how big and fat Becky is.  You&#8217;d think the doctor would tell him to take his ass out to the waiting room, but she just humors him as he steps over his wife&#8217;s wish to wait until the baby is born to find out its gender.  After a lot of prodding and interrupting, the doctor reveals that they&#8217;re actually having twins, which is a source of excitement for Becky and anxiety for Jesse.</p>
