                        <p>Well, here we are again.  Another week, another Full House review.  I wonder if this episode is going to be any good.  What do you think, everybody?</p>

<p>Becky tells Jesse that she wants to have a family picture taken but he refuses because he always has to give her shit any time she wants to do anything, even something simple like this.  He finally agrees to do it under the condition that the kids look &#8220;cool,&#8221; which is pretty much going to end up exactly how you think it will.</p>

<p>Stephanie is hanging out with her friend Rita when Michelle comes in and interrupts them by being a big attention starved asshole.  Rita is like the most amazing friend in the history of the show (excluding Kimmie Gibbler, of course.  She&#8217;s more than a friend.) because she has these really emotive reactions the second anything happens.  She&#8217;s really working hard for that $45 a day (plus craft services) that her Mom&#8217;s going to spend immediately.</p>

<p>Danny&#8217;s obsessive compulsive disorder really flies off the charts when he tries to teach DJ how to drive.  It&#8217;s kind of refreshing to see an episode that focuses on what a bad father Danny is.  I feel like he&#8217;s gotten off kind of easy a lot of the time, especially in the earlier Seasons when he was the only one with a job.  But, no, Danny Tanner is a terrible father with horrible kids, and don&#8217;t you ever forget it.  His compulsions don&#8217;t end with his constant irresistible drive for cleanliness.  He&#8217;s also a controlling weirdo, and completely incapable of giving his daughter simple driving instructions in an empty parking lot without getting into a big shitty argument and then driving home all pissed off.</p>
