This Joey guy&#8217;s just hanging out for like no reason, and his biggest development since moving into the full house is that he carries a woodchuck puppet around all the time now.  What a piece of shit!</p>
<p>Becky and Jesse enter the living room and get into an argument about how to raise their incredibly boring children.  Danny invites them to Tanner family fun night but they decline in favor of having a really lame subplot about their stupid mashed potato babies.</p>
<p>Naturally, Tanner family fun night takes place at the most ridiculous fucking restaurant imaginable.  It&#8217;s pirate themed, you guys.  PIRATE THEMED!  Their waiter is played by that comedian, Bruce Baum, who&#8217;s actually had a few other bit parts sprinkled throughout the series.</p>

<p>Danny makes everyone put on pirate hats and then the waiter comes back.  Stephanie orders some sort of elaborate, expensive seafood assortment and Michelle orders chocolate cake and nobody tries to stop either of them.  And then the fucking waiter abruptly leaves again!  He just says, &#8220;excuse me&#8221; and walks away!  I guess they do it for staging reasons, because a bunch of kids from DJ&#8217;s school walk by and the focus shifts to her not wanting to be seen by them, but even still, what the fuck?  Waiters do not order incrementally.</p>
<p>Jesse comes home and Becky gives him shit about taking one of the babies out without a hat on.  Jesse&#8217;s like, &#8220;of course I didn&#8217;t do the one thing you asked me to.  That&#8217;s, like, my whole thing.&#8221; and then the fighting escalates until they end up both calling their mothers.  I&#8217;m kind of surprised to see Becky putting up a fight here.  For the last bunch of episodes it really seemed like she&#8217;d given up completely.</p>

<p>Before walking the plank, Danny insists on giving a big lame speech to the whole restaurant about how he just wanted to have a fun night out with his corny family.  Stephanie is so touched by his contrivances that she offers to walk the plank instead, and then each of the rest of the family members follow suit.  After each family member has had an opportunity to bother everyone in the restaurant, they feel a new sense of family togetherness and joyously jump into the ball pit.  Tanner family fun night!</p>
