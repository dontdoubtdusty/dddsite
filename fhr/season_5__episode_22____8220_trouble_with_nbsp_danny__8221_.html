<p>Becky gets all excited when one of the babies starts crawling and calls Jesse to witness this incredibly banal scene.  The baby stops crawling the second Jesse shows up and then every time he turns his back they cut to a pre-recorded shot of the baby crawling until Jesse looks at him again.  It&#8217;s like those old Warner Brothers cartoons with the singing frog, except not funny or creative or at all unexpected.  Jesse remarks that, &#8220;the kids a potato,&#8221; which kind of blew my mind because that&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;ve been saying in these shitty reviews, and I was being a jerk.</p>

<p>Danny and Michelle enter the room to hand out fresh sponges but everyone tells them that they&#8217;re fucking sick of cleaning and are gonna call it a day.  Danny starts inspecting all of their cleaning jobs and Michelle chimes in after everything he says, which is a bit that gives me the strength to overcome the fear and go back to just regular ol&#8217; hating her again.</p>

<p>DJ calls an assembly of everyone but Danny into her room and then they all start bitching about him and, for the first time, approach some sort of legitimate recognition of how fucked up someone on this show actually is.  Everyone really unloads, too, and I have to say that it was pretty cathartic to see.  They even point out how badly Danny is fucking up Michelle with his creepy nonsense.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, it would have been way better if they&#8217;d all murdered him at the end of the scene or, better yet, murdered Joey, but I&#8217;ll take whatever display of negative enforcement I can get.</p>
<p>So then after everyone leaves, it turns out that Danny was installing shelf paper in the closet the whole time and overheard all their shit talking.  Aww.  I don&#8217;t know why the fuck he didn&#8217;t say anything and instead stood there silently in the closet while they all talked about him, but, still, aww.</p>

<p>Jesse sees the babies crawl and that&#8217;s the end of the Jesse-not-seeing-the-babies-crawl subplot. There&#8217;s not even like a zany twist or anything.  He&#8217;s just standing there and then Becky tells him to look because they&#8217;re crawling and then he does.</p>

<p>Danny runs upstairs and starts fucking up his room and then the rest of the family come in and tell him that they&#8217;ve deduced that he overheard their shit-talking session.  They all tell him they&#8217;re sorry and hug him and then Danny says that he&#8217;s going to try to find a balance between being a creepy clean freak and a fucked up slob, which concludes that this really is the most enlightened episode of this show ever.  Oh, moderation, how seldom it is that you rear your head in the full house!</p>

<p>In conclusion, I would just like to say that when Newsradio did this episode and Dave overheard everyone ragging on him, he got called out on being an eavesdropper at the end.</p>
<p>Firsts:  someone&#8217;s fucked up behavior is recognized as an actual problem</p>
