<p>What the fuck was I talking about?  Oh, yeah, so apparently Joey is also nominated for an award at the show because if rambling ass Danny can get nominated for one then so can any worthless asshole who sucks at hosting a show.</p>
<p>DJ comes home with Kimmie Gibbler and Danny immediately starts giving her a bunch of shit about being home late.  DJ quickly deflects his lectures by telling him that the hottest band in school are about to come over to record in Jesse&#8217;s basement studio so he&#8217;d better not pull some lame dad shit and embarrass her.</p>

<p>Just before leaving for the awards ceremony, Becky finds out that Aunt Ida wont be able to watch the boring ass babies that evening.  Stephanie volunteers to babysit them but is told that she&#8217;s too young, and Becky and Jesse eventually end up hiring Kimmie Gibbler.</p>

<p>As the dads all stand around in their suits, wondering what to do, I can&#8217;t help but feel for some reason that they should be tossing a football to each other.  Anyway, they all decide to forgo the awards ceremony so they can ruin DJ&#8217;s one chance to get busy.  Oh yeah, there&#8217;s also a bit where Joey&#8217;s suit came with 2 left shoes for some reason so he keeps walking in circles.</p>
<p>Kimmie Gibbler is too lazy and negligent to feed the babies so she hires Stephanie to do it for her.</p>

<p>After Pete leaves, DJ pulls back the curtains between the back and the front seat and finds the dads all sitting up front.  She is totally horrified by their presence and begs them to leave before Pete gets back because they&#8217;re humiliating on so many levels.  Pete comes back about 2 seconds later and, upon seeing the dads, realizes that there&#8217;s no way he&#8217;s even gonna get a hand-job on this date so he tells DJ to go home with her lame ass dads.</p>
