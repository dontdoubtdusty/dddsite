<p>After the kids shout the Ranger Joe theme song, Joey is called offstage to have a meeting with Mr. Strowbridge.  I guess it makes sense that the guy who runs Wake Up, San Francisco would also run the Ranger Joe show.  It&#8217;s cool, guys.  That one checks out.  No need to criticize.</p>
<p>Aaron Bailey asks Teddy if he wants to come and play at his house but Teddy says that he has plans to kick it with Michelle because they&#8217;re best friends.  Aaron Bailey is pretty outraged at this claim on the basis that bitches aint shit but hoes and tricks.</p>

<p>Joey starts bitching to Jesse about how his meeting with Mr. Strowbridge went super shitty because he wants Ranger Joe to have a sidekick.  Joey speculates about who his sidekick should be for a minute and then turns to Jesse and says, &#8220;there&#8217;s only one guy perfect for the job.&#8221;  Seriously, no shit.  Who the fuck else was it going to be?  I guess Danny, maybe.  Anyway, Jesse seems pretty committed to unemployment and argues against taking the job until Joey is able to persuade him by creating the role of &#8220;Lumberjack Jess.&#8221;  I don&#8217;t know why that appeals to him so much, but it does.</p>
<p>While gossiping on the phone with Kimmie Gibbler about who stuffs their bras at school, DJ catches Stephanie listening in on their conversation.  DJ takes advantage of the situation by allowing Stephanie to overhear that she&#8217;s about to be the victim of an elaborate scheme.</p>

<p>While Joey and Jesse rehearse for the debut of Lumberjack Jess, Michelle comes in and asks them what make girls different than boys.  Jesse struggles to provide an explanation and eventually tells her that boys lead in dancing, can grow beards and have shorter bathroom lines at public events.  That&#8217;s really all he tells her.</p>
<p>DJ fucks with Stephanie by offering her a brownie that Stephanie is convinced is tainted in some way, possibly by having been rubbed on someone&#8217;s taint.  Stephanie throws the brownie into the backyard and tells DJ that she knows all about her evil scheme because she listened in on her phone conversation.</p>

<p>Teddy and Aaron Bailey come back to the full house, which I thought was odd because they only just left, plus how are these kids getting around anyway?  I guess maybe they all live real near each other.  There&#8217;s actually a great bit of expository dialogue where Aaron Bailey asks why they&#8217;re there and Teddy tells him that Michelle has a surprise for them, then Aaron bailey says, &#8220;oh yeah.&#8221;  Way to lay out the premise, fellas.  Michelle comes down the stairs wearing pants and a jacket and says in a weird husky voice that she&#8217;s a boy now.  Way to work those acting chops, Olsen twin.  Danny looks perturbed but Teddy and Aaron Bailey buy it as a valid reason for them to all play together.</p>

<p>Michelle is immediately disqualified from being a boy when she tries to nurse the imaginary wounds inflicted on Teddy during their game of guns.  Teddy and Aaron Bailey ditch Michelle yet again and then Danny comes into the room because he&#8217;s really concerned about Michelle wanting to be a boy.  Seriously, even after the Julie Andrews confession, he feels a need to intervene here?  It&#8217;s bad enough that this show has treated homosexuality as a big ridiculous joke for 5 Seasons, now they have to undercut the transgender community, too?  I&#8217;m gonna call GLAAD about this shit.</p>
<p>The music comes on as Danny explains to Michelle that Teddy doesn&#8217;t want to hang out with her because he&#8217;s going through a stage and that if he&#8217;s really a rad friend then he&#8217;ll come back eventually.  Then he starts listing reasons why Michelle is awesome, which is pretty fucking hard to watch.  I guess the episode was running short or something.</p>

Michelle snubs Teddy and befriends Denise, who she seems to be meeting for the first time even though she was on the episode of the Ranger Joe show that was filmed at the beginning of the episode.</p>
