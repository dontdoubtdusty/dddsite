Anyway, there are a bunch of weird jokes about Mike Love wanting to eat Becky&#8217;s cooking and then the guys from the Beach Boys agree to have a jam session with Jesse and his shitty band.</p>
<p>After a performance of the Beach Boys song, &#8220;Forever,&#8221; the guys from the band offer to let Jesse record it as a single on his album.  Everyone celebrates this terrible idea by singing &#8220;Surfin&#8217; U.S.A.&#8221; while sitting around a bunch of food.</p>

<p>The record label guy says that if Jesse wants to make it big like such superstars as Michael Jackson and Hammer, he has to learn to dance.  Jesse makes a strong claim that he doesn&#8217;t dance, which the family all feel the need to back up, presumably because this has not been mentioned or addressed once in 5 Seasons.  There was even a clip earlier in the episode of Jesse doing an Elvis impersonation in which he did a choreographed dance, but whatever.  Anyway, for whatever reason, this qualifies as a cliffhanger, so we&#8217;ll have to wait until next week&#8217;s Season finale to find out what happens&#8230;</p>
