                        <p>As was conveniently established last episode, Jesse is a super shitty dancer, so he has to take lessons in order to perform in the upcoming music video for &#8220;Forever.&#8221;  The guys at his record label come by the full house to teach him some moves, and also to play him the rap version of &#8220;Forever&#8221; that they&#8217;ll be using for the video.  Jesse is dismayed by this news, but has little time to speak out about it before beginning a crash course in doing the running man.</p>

<p>As DJ coaxes Kimmie Gibbler through a late-night Spanish tutorial, Kimmie Gibbler becomes exhausted and makes the request, &#8220;el sleepo, bego-o please-o,&#8221; which reminds me of a lot of other similar jokes about the Spanish language that have been sprinkled throughout the series.  Why is saying &#8220;el&#8221; and then words in english with an &#8220;o&#8221; at the end of them supposed to be such a funny rendition of Spanish?  At least they didn&#8217;t mention the fast food chain El Pollo Loco this time.  Anyway, Danny knocks on the door because I guess he checks on DJ at midnight all the time and then the girls scramble to hide the fact that they&#8217;re up late studying even though that&#8217;s the squarest thing to cover up that I can even imagine.  Kimmie Gibbler hides under DJ&#8217;s covers while DJ hides in the closet and then Danny comes in and wants to kiss and talk about studying.  I don&#8217;t know, you guys.  All this kissing in the full house is starting to get pretty unsettling.  It&#8217;s bad enough to watch the Olsen Twins kiss John Stamos on the mouth fifty times every episode, but now we&#8217;ve got Danny coming into DJ&#8217;s room in the middle of the night and sitting on the edge of the bed, trying to score smooches.  Deeply unsettling.</p>

<p>Michelle hustles enough lemonade stand money out of Joey to buy her stupid ant farm.  Just then, Jesse and Becky come downstairs as Jesse makes a big statement about how he&#8217;s going to do the Arabian genie themed music video under the unlikely pretense that he actually gives a shit about providing for his wife and family.  Michelle offers him her ant farm money so he can start his own record label and the audience members are all deeply touched.  Jesse himself is so touched that he gives her a big kiss, right on the mouth.</p>

<p>Some time later, Kimmie Gibbler comes over to let everyone in the full house know that she passed her Spanish class so she&#8217;ll be going to Spain with DJ for the Summer after all.  Jesse comes downstairs and summons everyone to the living room so they can see him on MTV.  You see, kids, back in the early 90&#8217;s, MTV showed music videos all the time.</p>

FUCK.  How am I ever going to describe this video?  First of all, it seems to be filmed at that same little house or church or whatever in the desert that like ten million early 90&#8217;s music videos were filmed in.  You know, the one with all the candles inside?  The video also uses many tropes that you may be familiar with, like tilted camera angles, abrupt zoom-ins, and some really sexy fade-aways.</p>
