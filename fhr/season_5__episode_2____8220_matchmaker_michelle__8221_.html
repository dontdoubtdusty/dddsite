<p>Jesse and Joey wander off to go work on their stupid idea, leaving Becky alone in the kitchen as she eats an entire turkey.  I find it remarkable that this joke about her eating an enormous amount of food is purely visual, as nobody makes a single stupid remark about it.  That&#8217;s gotta be as close as this show&#8217;s ever come to subtlety.  Anyway, Michelle approaches Aunt Becky and asks how she might go about finding a mommy for herself.  Becky, displaying the lack of reasoning or sensitivity she&#8217;s developed since moving into the full house, ignores the deeper psychological issues that are clearly being presented to her and simply offers up some idiotic advice about candlelight dinners being a catalyst for two people falling in love.  When Michelle asks why Danny never seems to get any pussy, Becky hypothesizes that it&#8217;s because he&#8217;s got an obsessive compulsive cleaning problem and never shuts the fuck up, so maybe she&#8217;s not so far gone after all.</p>
<p>Kimmie Gibbler, playing the role of DJ, orders Stephanie to go get her a doughnut, but Stephanie just tells her to fuck off.</p>

Michelle convinces Danny to invite June Lockhart over for lunch, certain that that this will inevitably lead to him inserting his penis into her geriatric vagina, followed by a wedding ceremony.</p>
<p>Stephanie hides in the closet because she&#8217;s so sick of Kimmie Gibbler&#8217;s incessant rambling, which provides us with another sweet shot of that Bell Biv Devoe poster.  Seriously, where can I buy one of those?  DJ stops by to pick up her skates for roller derby night at the Gibbler&#8217;s and says she&#8217;s having a pretty good time over there.  That&#8217;s actually the final mention of this tertiary storyline, which never amounted to anything or made any sense.</p>

<p>As Danny heads to the door to let June Lockhart in, Michelle gives him some flowers to hand to her and reminds him not to talk about himself like an asshole.  June Lockhart enters, sporting a coat with some awe-inspiring shoulder pads, and Michelle immediately starts pressuring them into doing the nasty.</p>

<p><strong>A Few Announcements:  </strong></p>
<p>FHR has some new developments thanks to a few helpful people working behind the scenes.  For starters, there&#8217;s a brand new <a href="http://fullhousereviewed.proboards.com/">Full House Reviewed forum</a>!  Fans have been conversing quite a bit in the comments section, so a forum seemed like a natural progression for the site.  It&#8217;s run by a FHR insider who goes by the name of Potatey, but I should be dropping in from time to time myself.  Check that shit out!</p>
<p>There are also ads on the site now and every time you click on them I get a tiny bit of money!  I&#8217;d really appreciate it if you&#8217;d get in the habit of spending less than a second clicking on an ad when you visit the site, which would be really helpful with paying for the costs of maintaining it.  I&#8217;m sure as hell not trying to get rich writing this blog, but web hosting aint free and it&#8217;d be really nice if it would at least pay for itself.</p>
