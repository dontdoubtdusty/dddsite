<p>Jesse comes home from the store with a bunch of chips for Becky, who is making lots of requests due to her pregnancy cravings.  She tells him that she wants a different kind of chips and he says that he figured that when she kept paging him while he was at the store (remember pagers?  Although they&#8217;re completely obsolete now, I still think they&#8217;ve aged better as a reference than that plagiarized Rob Schneider schtick) and so he brought home a whole shitload.  He dumps all the bags of chips all over the table as if to say that the joke about her being pregnant and eating a lot was too understated in the last episode so now they have to overdo it as much as possible.</p>

<p>Becky invites Danny and Joey to attend her childbirth class but they decline because they’ve got tickets for a Warriors game.  Then they see Lisa, the childbirth class’s instructor, and since they both want to fuck her they decide to stick around.</p>

<p>DJ comes downstairs and tells that dads that she has an important presentation for them.  They all go into the kitchen, where Michelle is collaborating with the dog in a further attempt to open one of those bags of chips.  I thought that this might evolve into a whole tertiary storyline but that&#8217;s actually the end of it.</p>

<p>Stephanie tells Michelle that they’ll be sharing a room soon and Michelle says that she’s hella pissed about it and gives her a raspberry.  Michelle then heads upstairs in protest, leaving Stephanie to sit in the kitchen to feel sorry for herself as sad music plays.  Aww.</p>

<p>After the class, all of the pregnant women engage in an eating frenzy that horrifies their husbands.  Becky makes some more requests for Jesse to get them some other kinds of food and then he launches into a whole diatribe about how it’s total bullshit that he should have to put in any extra effort to comfort his pregnant wife.  Becky becomes extremely emotional, resulting in Jesse feeling obligated to comfort her, and then she becomes apologetic and says that she doesn’t deserve him.  Jesse agrees but then acquiesces that he’ll make an effort to accommodate her needs just as long as he still never has to get a job.</p>

<p>This still leaves the problem of Michelle not wanting to room with Stephanie, but it&#8217;s quickly resolved when they offer her some cookies.  What a fucking idiot.</p>
<p>Firsts:  Joey’s spitting problem is addressed, DJ having her own room, Stephanie and Michelle sharing a room</p>
<p><strong>Announcement Follow-Up:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Have you guys checked out <a href="http://fullhousereviewed.proboards.com/">the FHR forum</a> yet?  It&#8217;s pretty neat.  I&#8217;m trying to get a haiku competition going on over there.  I wrote the first one, now you go.</p>
<p>Also, thanks so much for clicking the ads!  I&#8217;m trying to think of a good way to continue to encourage you guys to do this without writing an annoying reminder at the end of every post.  I&#8217;m kind of stuck between being a person that hates advertising and being a person that could really benefit from it.  What do you guys think?  Maybe we could talk about it on the <a href="http://fullhousereviewed.proboards.com/">FHR forum.</a></p>
