                        <p>Pre-Credits Gag:  Jesse shows Michelle the new recording studio that he&#8217;s built in Joey&#8217;s old jerk-off dungeon.  Michelle wants to sing a song into the recording equipment and then attempts to perform Aretha Franklin&#8217;s &#8220;Respect.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Danny ducks under the counter to get some more cleaning products to clean his cleaning products with, DJ and Kimmie Gibbler come in through the back door and are like, &#8220;Damn, that was some serious shit that went down at school today!&#8221;  Danny pops up from behind the counter and is like, &#8220;What shit went down at school today?  You have to tell me about every single thing that ever happens in your life,&#8221; and then DJ and Kimmie Gibbler sneak upstairs.</p>

<p>As Michelle unpacks the last of her shit in the room that she&#8217;s now sharing with Stephanie, it becomes painfully clear that the Bell Biv Devoe poster that used to be up on the wall has disappeared forever.  I&#8217;m definitely sure that it wasn&#8217;t up in DJ&#8217;s new room, either.  That sucks, you guys.  That was like the only good thing.  Danny comes into their room and is like, &#8220;Hey you guys, I couldn&#8217;t help but notice that DJ&#8217;s having some sort of private problem, so I was hoping you guys would tell me all of her personal business,&#8221; but the girls, having been relegated to the stupid baby room, don&#8217;t know shit.</p>

<p>Jesse shows Joey and Becky the red light he&#8217;s put up at the top of the basement staircase to indicate when he is recording a terrible song down there and should not be disturbed.  This prompts Joey to go into a routine about Godzilla movies that goes on for about a hundred thousand years.</p>

<p>Down in the basement, Joey gets all nostalgic about his partnership with Jesse, which has apparently come to a close.  Now that he&#8217;s married to a rich lady, Jesse just wants to fuck around on his guitar in the basement full-time, which leaves Joey to pursue a full-time comedy career that will require a much more serious commitment to masturbating and eating ice cream on the couch.  It&#8217;s been really heartwarming to watch these boys grow into men over the years.</p>

<p>After deciding to leave the uncles to their anal lovefest, Danny confides in Becky that he&#8217;s concerned about the mega crisis that DJ is having.  He hesitantly admits that he found out about it by going through her shit when she wasn&#8217;t around and then DJ appears in the kitchen and says that she&#8217;s going over to Kimmie Gibbler&#8217;s.  Danny tries once again to worm his way into her personal business but after she deflects him and leaves, he whines to Aunt Becky, who tells him that he shouldn&#8217;t have went through DJ&#8217;s shit in the first place.  Danny says that DJ&#8217;s newfound need for personal space makes him feel like he&#8217;s losing her and then sad music plays and then commercials come on.</p>
<p>As DJ and Kimmie Gibbler head out the door, they try to come up with a plan to clear DJ&#8217;s reputation as a bad kisser.  Kimmie Gibbler suggests that DJ makes out with every guy in school and then it doesn&#8217;t seem so ridiculous when Danny tries to get all up in their business yet again.  Danny insists on some impromptu quality time and absolutely will not leave DJ alone until she agrees to go bowling with him.  Kimmie Gibbler flees the scene immediately, as she always does whenever DJ finds herself in a compromising situation, leaving DJ alone with her corny, overbearing dad.</p>
<p>Stephanie hates a cuddly bear wall hanging that Michelle puts up in their room (it&#8217;s definitely not as cool as that Bell Biv Devoe poster, I&#8217;ll tell you that much) and tries to manipulate Michelle into taking it down by offering her a membership into the &#8220;big girls club.&#8221;  Stephanie says that big girls don&#8217;t have lame baby shit like stuffed bears and convinces Michelle to take the wall hanging down, but then Michelle says that under those circumstances Stephanie should also have to get rid of Mr. Bear.  Damn, way to totally get outsmarted by a four year old, Stephanie.  All the bears remain in their room and then they celebrate by singing their big girl club song three times in a row.  You know what?  Me and a couple of my friends ended up at the &#8220;Big Girls Club&#8221; downtown one night and, without getting into too much detail, I&#8217;ll just say that it was a little different than this.</p>

<p>At the bowling alley, Danny won&#8217;t shut the fuck up for two seconds and constantly narrates his own bowling technique and yells and hops around like an asshole.  When it&#8217;s DJ&#8217;s turn to bowl, he gets up right behind her and spouts a constant stream of bowling advice that really makes you feel sorry for her.  Why&#8217;s DJ&#8217;s motivation for avoiding Danny have to be some big secret she&#8217;s keeping when there are so many obvious reasons why she wouldn&#8217;t want to spend any time with him?  Why are the real problems never addressed!??!</p>
