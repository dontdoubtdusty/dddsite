                        <p>This episode doesn&#8217;t have a pre-credits gag, presumably because it has a lengthy musical number at the end.  I wish I&#8217;d been warned about that ahead of time.  I really do.</p>
<p>This episode also premiers some new footage in the opening sequence.  Well, I&#8217;m pretty sure that it premiers in this episode.  I skip the opening sequence a lot, so they might have added the new footage a few episodes ago.  I&#8217;m sure someone will correct me if I&#8217;m wrong.  Anyway, not much has changed, and there&#8217;s still that great shot of Lori Loughlin&#8217;s ass, so why even mention it?  Well, they changed the most updated shots of all the girls in their little growing-up montages, which includes replacing that horrifying shot of the Olsen twin jumping on her bed with a shot of her playing the drums, so that&#8217;s an improvement.  Most importantly, however, is the addition of Kimmie Gibbler to the opening credits.  That&#8217;s right, motherfuckers, you better recognize Kimmie Gibbler!</p>

<p>For some reason Joey is invited to the Tanner family reunion and they&#8217;re all counting on him to win the pie eating contest.  Danny pulls a couple of pies from I&#8217;m not sure where and then offers them to Joey for practice.  Aunt Becky decides to challenge him to a pie eating sparring match and then there&#8217;s a pretty long sequence of everyone staring around cheering while they eat pies.  What an odd scene.  Did anyone&#8217;s family on earth ever actually gather around and do stuff like this?  Sometimes this show feels like a Franz Kafka story that&#8217;s based off of a Norman Rockwell painting, except without any of the thought or craft.  The most bizarre moment in the scene is when they cut to Michelle chanting, &#8220;be a piggy&#8221; over and over again.</p>

<p>Jesse tells everyone that he just had a meeting with a record producer who said that he&#8217;d give him a contract if he could produce a hit song.  Michelle&#8217;s like, &#8220;who gives a shit about that?  I want to talk about how you&#8217;re going to be my partner at the balloon race at our stupid corny family reunion.&#8221;  Well, see, she didn&#8217;t say that exactly.  I&#8217;m paraphrasing.</p>

<p>The Tanners all assemble in the living room to get ready for their stupid cornball family reunion.  Joey comes down and talks all competitively with Aunt Becky about the pie eating contest, which only makes me wonder once more why he&#8217;s even invited to the family reunion in the first place.  How do they explain to the other relatives who he is?  &#8220;This is my unemployed friend who sleeps in the same hallways as all of my young daughters.  He does impressions.&#8221;  Also, I kind of love those Bay Area Tanners shirts.</p>

<p>Jesse stumbles into the living room, exhausted by actually trying to do some work for once.  He says that he can&#8217;t go to the stupid corny family reunion, which should be fine because it&#8217;s not like he&#8217;s even related to anyone at that thing anyway.  Why should he have to go to an annual gathering of his dead sister&#8217;s husband&#8217;s family?  I guess this is one of those things that Danny gets to force the uncles to do because he pays for all of their room and board.  Anyway, Michelle get&#8217;s all pissed at Jesse for refusing to go to the family reunion because he&#8217;s her partner for that balloon race, and she really gets in his face about it until he walks off and says, &#8220;leave me alone.&#8221;  Michelle is deeply shocked by anyone refusing to do something that she wants them to and tells Danny that &#8220;Uncle Jesse&#8217;s not nice anymore,&#8221; as gentle music plays and everyone gathers around to console her.  Damn, she&#8217;s totally willing to dismiss four years of unrelenting subservience just because he refused to go to a single balloon race.  He can go die in a hole for all she cares now.</p>

<p>As the Bay Area Tanners sit stranded on the side of the road next to their broken down van, Jesse miraculously pulls up on his motorcycle and fixes it in like 2 seconds.  He explains that he had a revelation about how wrong he was to put his futile career pursuit before his obnoxious, self-absorbed family and came to meet them at the stupid reunion.</p>
