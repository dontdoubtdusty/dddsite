<p>Jesse eagerly tells DJ that he hopes his twins are a boy and a girl so he can name them Elvis and Priscilla.  Ok, never mind how creepy his stupid Elvis obsession is even, just think about how he wants to name his children after a married couple.  Jesse then goes on a big thing about how a person&#8217;s name determines their whole life and then DJ asks him why he&#8217;s so obsessed with names even though he just explained why.  Jesse then alludes to having gotten some shit about his name as a kid but then he doesn&#8217;t want to say more, which prompts DJ to invade his privacy in the very near future.  What else did he think would happen?  Privacy and the full house are like Joey and hilarious jokes.</p>

<p>If you had assumed that the next thing that would happen would be a radio station calling with a trivia question about Deputy Dog, then you, my friend, were correct.  Joey wins two tickets to a Donny and Marie show and then, signifying even further that his luck&#8217;s about to change, the cable guy shows up immediately when Joey was afraid he&#8217;d have to wait all day.  And what&#8217;s more, the cable guy&#8217;s a fine ass broad.</p>

This seemed pretty far-fetched to me, but then I remembered that there&#8217;s some kind of rule on tv where a repair person has to either be a big fat guy or a really easy sexy lady.  I don&#8217;t know why this is, but it&#8217;s true even on good shows.</p>
<p>Joey musters up some courage and follows the cable lady into the living room, where she tells him that she scored him some extra channels for free and then turns on the tv to reveal the most sexual image that&#8217;s ever been on the show.</p>

<p>After the cable lady leaves, Jesse comes into the living room and tells Joey that it&#8217;s time for them to watch Wake Up, San Francisco.  I wonder if they watch it together every day while they sit in Danny&#8217;s house and eat his food and don&#8217;t have jobs.  Danny introduces the episode&#8217;s guest, Ranger Roy, and then he goes into a long ramble until Becky tells him to shut the fuck up because their show&#8217;s only half an hour long.  I thought this was remarkable because I&#8217;d always assumed that Wake Up, San Francisco was an hour-long show.  Aren&#8217;t all morning shows at least an hour long?</p>

<p>At the start of Joey&#8217;s audition, he busts out Mr. Woodchuck and tells a single joke about wood before hanging him up.  I was going to have to mention this sooner or later, so I&#8217;ll just point out here that Joey has no ventriloquism skills whatsoever and that they try to resolve this by zooming in on Mr. Woodchuck whenever his voice is being done.  Anyway, the rest of the audition is just Joey doing those stupid fucking impressions that I hate so much.  After literally 30 seconds of auditioning, Ranger Roy says that Joey is clearly the guy that he&#8217;s looking for and hires him.  Joey is so overjoyed by this news that he starts aggressively hugging Ranger Roy and wont stop, even when Danny tries desperately to pry him off and tells him, &#8220;stop hugging him!&#8221;</p>

Also, the guy who plays Ranger Roy has the most amazing face in the world.</p>

<p>Comet the dog walks in carrying Michelle&#8217;s tap shoes in his mouth, followed by Jesse, who says that they were buried in the yard.  Stephanie admits that she buried them and then launches into a frantic monologue about how Michelle is driving her crazy, but then everyone just ignores her as she walks away.  After that annoying diversion wraps up, Michelle refers to Jesse as &#8220;Uncle Hermes&#8221; and then everyone laughs at him.  Jesse tells everyone that the name Hermes is rad and if they don&#8217;t like it then they can go fuck themselves and that&#8217;s pretty much the end of the Uncle Hermes story.  It&#8217;s weird how they&#8217;ve been using these tertiary plotlines that don&#8217;t go anywhere lately.  I guess they&#8217;re better than all those dream sequences they used to do to pad episodes.</p>
<p>Danny tries to tell Joey about how he got fired for his irresponsible hugging but he&#8217;s interrupted by a phone call about Joey&#8217;s Donny and Marie tickets being revoked and then the sexy cable lady coming over and telling Joey that there&#8217;s no way that she&#8217;s gonna fuck him if he doesn&#8217;t have Donny and Marie tickets.  As Joey tries to process this series of misfortunes, Danny tells him that he&#8217;s been fired by Ranger Roy.  After Danny explains Ranger Roy&#8217;s condition, Joey rushes off to intercept the hugagram he sent him, which is like a telegram except with hugging.  I&#8217;m not even going to question whether or not that&#8217;s a real thing.</p>
