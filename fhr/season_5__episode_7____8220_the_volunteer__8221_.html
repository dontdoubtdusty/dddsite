                        <p>This episode doesn&#8217;t have a pre-credits gag, which made me nervous because the last time that happened there was a lengthy Jesse and the Rippers performance at the end.  Thankfully that wasn&#8217;t the case this time, which leaves me wondering why we&#8217;re just left holding our dicks, pre-credits gagless.  Maybe they&#8217;re going to stop having them all together?  I&#8217;m pretty sure that bumpers like that are intended to snag casual viewers by offering them a portion of the show before they have to sit through the credits, so maybe by this point the series was popular enough that they didn&#8217;t think they needed them anymore.  Or maybe they just forgot to do them sometimes because nobody working on this show gave a shit about anything.  I guess we&#8217;ll just have to wait and see.</p>

<p>DJ comes downstairs to remind Danny that she&#8217;ll be home late because she&#8217;s volunteering her time at a senior citizens home.  I think that if most people&#8217;s high school age kids said something like that then it would be a pretty dead giveaway that they were doing cocaine, but Danny totally buys it.  DJ tries to strengthen her ruse by asking Danny and Joey what she should talk to her adopted old person about but all she gets for advice are impressions of the Three Stooges.</p>

<p>Wait, DJ really was going to an old folks home?  Maybe there&#8217;s cocaine inside.  We&#8217;re introduced to DJ&#8217;s adopted old person, Eddie Johnson, as we watch him kick the shit out of another old guy at cards who, incidentally, will play Jerry Seinfeld&#8217;s adopted old person later in the decade.  DJ and Eddie meet and have a hard time finding common ground until he starts to recall his youth playing guest roles on Sanford and Son and 227.  Eddie tells DJ that she reminds him of his estranged daughter, Gloria, and then he challenges her to a game of bumper pool.</p>

<p>As DJ and Eddie head to the backyard to judge the dog show, Eddie becomes confused and starts calling DJ &#8220;Gloria&#8221; and telling her to get ready for school.  DJ&#8217;s like, &#8220;what&#8217;s your fucking problem, Eddie?  I&#8217;m counting on you to help me evaluate this dog show and now I&#8217;m really doubting your perspicacity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Danny comes home and shows Jesse the pooper scooper that he&#8217;s purchased as first prize for the dog competition.  Jesse tells Danny that he&#8217;s gonna cheat on his bet with Becky and take the pregnancy suit off for a while because he&#8217;s totally unwilling to put any effort into anything and has no respect for his pregnant wife.  While he sits and bemoans his aching back, Becky sneaks up behind him and starts rubbing his neck.  Jesse, quite naturally, assumes that Danny is the one who is tenderly rubbing him and then right before he asks for a reach-around he finds out that it&#8217;s Becky.  He tries to weasel his way out of losing the bet but Becky tells him that he&#8217;s fuckin&#8217; done, son, and their kids are going to have circus wallpaper.  I actually have to admit that having Elvis wallpaper would probably be less psychologically damaging for a child than clown wallpaper, but a bet&#8217;s a bet.</p>

She also makes a big point about how friends should be honest with each other so Eddie explains that he has bouts of confusion occasionally.</p>

<p>DJ asks Danny about what&#8217;s wrong with Eddie and they have one of those special conversations that only a sheltered, privileged child and her rich father can have.  He explains that Eddie has Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and that he&#8217;s only going to get worse and then DJ says, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe this!  I really liked Eddie.&#8221; (Note the past tense.)  Danny isn&#8217;t able to offer much advice about caring for the elderly because he&#8217;s callously discarded two separate actresses who&#8217;ve played his mother over the course of the series so DJ just continues to feel sorry for herself.  Eventually the music comes on and Danny says some crap about how making people happy is great or something and then DJ gets up and runs downstairs.</p>
<p>DJ stops Eddie just as he&#8217;s walking out the door and invites him to stay for dinner.  The nurse says that he can stay even though the whole reason she&#8217;s there is to come get him because he&#8217;s not allowed out of the home and then Eddie and DJ head to the kitchen, arm in arm, to set the table.</p>
