<p>Pre-Credits Gag:  Hey, the pre-credits gag is back!  Can anyone tell me why they don&#8217;t always have them anymore?  I&#8217;m stumped.  Anyway, this one opens with DJ looking sad while staring at the phone because she&#8217;s waiting for some boy to call.  Although that&#8217;s funny enough all on its own, Michelle soon enters the scene and asks DJ why she&#8217;s just sitting there, looking desperate.  DJ explains that she&#8217;s waiting for a boy to call but she&#8217;s tired of hanging around by the phone and then the minute she gets up the phone rings and Michelle answers it.  Naturally, Michelle tells the boy that he&#8217;s a shithead and hangs up on him, salting DJ&#8217;s game.  Poor DJ, she&#8217;s never gonna get any ass.  Never.</p>
<p>Stephanie&#8217;s teacher thinks that she might have a chance at a career in professional dance for some reason but Danny isn&#8217;t sure if she should pursue it so Stephanie decides to constantly nag him until he changes his mind.  Danny warns her that it&#8217;ll be an awful lot of hard work and that she&#8217;s never been exposed to anyone with any sort of a work ethic because she grew up in the full house but Stephanie is pretty fucking determined to keep harassing him until he caves in.  Danny starts reminiscing about his youthful dream of being a high-jump champion and Stephanie uses this unrequited passion to successfully manipulate him into allowing her to take the lessons.</p>
<p>Everyone tells Becky that there&#8217;s no way that she&#8217;ll be able to convince Jesse to attend her baby shower but she protests that it&#8217;s the 90&#8217;s and men are way cooler about that kind of shit now.  Remember when everyone used to always say &#8220;it&#8217;s the 90&#8217;s&#8221;?  I wish I didn&#8217;t.  After everyone reminds her that Jesse&#8217;s like the shittiest husband in the world and he won&#8217;t even get a job to support his unborn children much less attend an event that&#8217;s important to his wife, Becky decides to construct an elaborate lie about it just being a regular party by inviting a bunch of Jesse&#8217;s friends.  Everyone agrees to keep it a secret but just then Jesse enters the scene and gets all suspicious.  Becky tells him that she&#8217;s organizing a party for them as a last hurrah before they become parents and then when Jesse offers to help organize it she says, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take care of everything and all you have to do is show up,&#8221; which pretty much defines their entire relationship.</p>

<p>After some corny party games are played at the baby shower, Jesse comes homes and everyone yells &#8220;Surprise!&#8221;  Can I just say that this is the most convoluted premise in the series so far?  Let me see if I&#8217;ve got this right:  Becky wanted Jesse to come to her baby shower but she knew he wouldn&#8217;t so she told him that it was going to be a regular party.  So what exactly was supposed to happen when he figured it out?  Why would she put herself in that situation?  But anyway it doesn&#8217;t even matter because Jesse already knew about the secret baby shower and invited a bunch of filthy biker guys as revenge, adding an extra-ridiculous twist to an already inexplicable narrative.</p>

<p>Before Stephanie&#8217;s big dance performance, Danny sneaks backstage and tells her that if her performance goes well she&#8217;ll be admitted into a rigorous Summer dance program.  Stephanie is clearly distressed over the idea but Danny continues to willfully ignore her feelings.  After the presenter has to tell Danny to turn his bright ass camera light off because it&#8217;s bothering everybody, that delightful tune &#8220;Motown Philly&#8221; by the timeless Boyz II Men comes on and a bunch of little girls dance onstage in bastardized versions of that Janet Jackson Rhythm Nation get-up except with sequins and an exposed mid-riff.  Creepy!  All of a sudden Stephanie starts to bust out some really odd dance moves that clearly aren&#8217;t part of the routine and then all of the other girls just stand there and stare at her like, &#8220;what the fuck?&#8221;  Stephanie says she&#8217;s sorry and runs offstage and then an intermission is called.</p>

<p>Danny and Stephanie hug and say that they love each other and then she apologizes to the other girls for fucking up the dance but none of them seem to even give a shit.  They all just shrug it off.  She asks if they can have another shot at doing the routine and then, even though there shouldn&#8217;t be any mulligans in dance if you ask me, the presenter says to go right ahead because what the fuck else are they gonna show the audience?  It&#8217;s not like parents ever expect this kind of shit to be any good anyway.</p>
