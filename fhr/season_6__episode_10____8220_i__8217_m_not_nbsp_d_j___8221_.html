<p>Just as Stephanie and Michelle are sitting down for a tea party, the Jennifer&#8217;s show up at their door.  Oh!  What&#8217;s more humiliating than getting caught playing tea party by the cool kids?  Stephanie tries to take Michelle aside and explain that she can&#8217;t be seen fraternizing with some stupid troll faced baby so she has to get the fuck out of the room until the Jennifer&#8217;s leave.  Michelle totally disregards Stephanie&#8217;s words and refuses to leave until Stephanie pleads with her and promises to include her the next time something important happens.  Left to her own devices, Michelle straight up actually says, &#8220;Who can I bother?&#8221; before heading off to DJ&#8217;s room.  What an odd, self-aware moment!</p>
<p>The Jennifer&#8217;s screen Stephanie for cool interests, including shaving their legs and watching Arsenio.  Man, these girls sound fun!  Stephanie shows them her new earrings and they realize that Stephanie only wears clip-ons.  They say that not having pierced ears is totally lame and immature so Stephanie assures them they she&#8217;ll be getting her ears pierced at the mall that very weekend.</p>
<p>Stephanie&#8217;s goes into DJ&#8217;s room and interrupts the study session she&#8217;s having with Steve and Kimmie Gibbler to ask if DJ will take her to the mall to get her ears pierced.  DJ says that she needs Danny&#8217;s permission to get it done and they both agree that he&#8217;s too big a fucking square to let Stephanie get her ears pierced while she&#8217;s still in the 5th grade.  DJ walks Steve to the door as he leave for wrestling practice and then, after they&#8217;re left alone, Kimmie Gibbler offers to pierce Stephanie&#8217;s ears herself using her brother&#8217;s ear-gun.</p>
<p>Jesse sits down to cut the twins hair but Danny keeps interrupting him with stories of shitty haircuts his dad gave him until Jesse eventually decides to take the kids to Joey&#8217;s uncle Jasper.  Stephanie comes downstairs and tries to trick Danny into agreeing to let her get her ears pierced but he points out that DJ had to wait until Junior High to get her ears pierced so she does, too.  Stephanie&#8217;s says that Danny is being unfair and asks him how she&#8217;ll ever be cool if she can&#8217;t get her ears pierced.  Newsflash, kid, you could pierce whatever you want, you&#8217;re still gonna be a fuckin&#8217; square.  Every aspect of your personality and lifestyle is deeply uncool.</p>
<p>Stephanie brings Kimmie Gibbler up to her room for some at-home ear piercing.  They try to kick Michelle out of their room but are forced to let her stay when she reminds Stephanie of the deal they made to include her the next time something important happened. Kimmie Gibbler prepares to use the ear-gun as dramatic music plays, which makes for a pretty tense pre-commercial break cliffhanger.</p>

<p>Becky and Jesse take the twins to the barber shop and it turns out that Jasper is played by&#8230;Dave Coulier.  But why?  Did a guest star back out?  Or did Dave Coulier want to do something beyond the extraordinarily limited tv persona he&#8217;d created for himself?  If so, he sure doesn&#8217;t do it here, because Jasper is just Joey doing another lame voice while wearing a cheap wig and mustache.</p>
