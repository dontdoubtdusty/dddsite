<p>The Uncles come home all bummed out because their station is getting a new manager who is known for firing people. Becky does her best to cope with the fact that her husband can&#8217;t ever keep a job for more than 5 minutes by consoling him.  Ah, codependency!  Danny comes in and explains to everyone that Vicky&#8217;s mom is in town and then Joey reminds him to check her out because that&#8217;s what Vicky&#8217;s gonna look like when she gets older.</p>

<p>Vicky&#8217;s mom checks out Stephanie and Michelle&#8217;s room and starts making interior decorating tips because, by the way, she&#8217;s an interior decorator.  The girls get all excited by her suggestions but then Danny says that he wants to keep the girls&#8217; room the way it is because he does not like new things.</p>
<p>Kimmie Gibbler tries to get Steve to hook her up with one of the dudes on the wrestling team but he can&#8217;t think of anyone who&#8217;d be interested.  Seriously?  I guess they&#8217;ve never seen her in those tight ass dresses that she wears over at the full house sometimes.  Danny comes in with Vicky and her mom but then Vicky&#8217;s gigantic, incredibly dated pager goes off so she goes into the other room to take a work call.  Everyone attempts to keep Vicky&#8217;s mom entertained while Vicky&#8217;s in the other room so Kimmie Gibbler starts saying a bunch of stupid shit about Danny and Vicky getting married until Steve carries her out of the house while she makes comments about how hot his ass is.</p>

<p>Joey interrupts Jesse while he&#8217;s trying to eat fried chicken in peace in the living room by telling him that he thinks that they&#8217;ll be able to adjust to the station&#8217;s supposed switch over to classical music.  He then does an extended rendition of &#8220;Flight of the Bumblebee&#8221; with his lips, which makes no sense.  If the station actually was going to switch to classical music, I don&#8217;t think that they&#8217;d expect their DJ&#8217;s to perform the music with their mouths.</p>

<p>Stephanie and Michelle try to sleep in DJ&#8217;s room at night so DJ goes and gets Danny to help her kick them out.  Danny comes in and wants to know what&#8217;s going on and then they say that they don&#8217;t like their new room because it made Danny and Vicky fight, which makes the audience go, &#8220;aww.&#8221;  Danny says that it&#8217;s no big deal and that he&#8217;s on the outs with Vicky because it will give him time to learn how to scuba dive and then he tells them to go sleep in their own room, for fucks sake.</p>
<p>The uncles complete what they think might be their last radio show and then they see their new boss giving what they perceive to be a pink slip to one of their co-workers.  She comes into the booth and hands the uncles ominous envelopes and then, before opening it, Jesse gets all irate and quits.  After Jesse storms out of the booth, the new boss explains to Joey that the envelopes have parking passes in them and then she gets all upset and starts crying and hugging Joey because that&#8217;s what having a woman boss is like.  Joey grabs Jesse and explains the situation to him and then Jesse comes back to the booth and makes up with their new boss.  They explain that they thought that she was firing their co-worker and then she said that she did, indicating that she is in fact some sort of a hard-ass.  I guess this is supposed to be an introduction to a new character here but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if we never see her again.  If she ever does show up again I bet she ends up bangin&#8217; Joey.</p>

<p>Stephanie pulls Michelle into the backyard and convinces her to stick her head in the fence.  On the other side of the fence, Michelle finds Kimmie Gibbler grilling sardines in her own backyard. I wish we got to see more of Kimmie Gibbler&#8217;s house.  Her fence has all these weird paintings all over it but that&#8217;s about all you see.  What an intriguing enigma you are, Kimmie Gibbler.  Why do you do the things you do?</p>

<p>Danny gets all pissed at the girls but then they admit that their hijinks were an attempt to get him and Vicky back together.  Why do the girls even give a shit about Vicky, anyway?  The woman has no personality whatsoever.  The other new character, Steve, has like 5 personality traits already, making him maybe the most developed character in the series, but Vicky&#8217;s got jack shit.</p>
<p>Danny and Vicky are left alone together and then he explains that her mom was putting marriage pressure on him and it freaked him out.  The music comes on as they discuss growth and change in relationships and then they say they love each other and hug.  Do you think they&#8217;ve done it yet?  Probably not.</p>

<p>Oh also thanks so much to everyone who donated money for web hosting!  I was able to buy two more years of hosting for the site so it&#8217;ll be up until well after the project is done and then I&#8217;ll figure out some other cheap or free way to stash it on the internet, like I&#8217;ll go back to wordpress or something.  Thanks so much for your support, everyone!  You guys are the shit!</p>
