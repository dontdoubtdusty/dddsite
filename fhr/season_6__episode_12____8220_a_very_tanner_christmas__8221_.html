                        <p>Pre-Credits Gag:  Michelle wants to put an enormous stocking up for herself above the fireplace.  That&#8217;s right, motherfuckers, it&#8217;s Christmas at the full house!</p>

<p>As Danny and Joey bring in the Christmas tree, Becky reminisces about the white Christmases of her youth in Nebraska and then Stephanie and Michelle start going on and on about all the presents they want.  Jesse is affected by their rampant consumerism and tries to explain to them that there&#8217;s more to the holidays than just getting presents, then he tells them that he&#8217;s just thought of the perfect gift for them.</p>

Lots of set-ups here, you guys.</p>
<p>Steve comes over to exchange gifts with DJ.  She gives him a really expensive jacket and he gets her a sweatshirt from his new college.  She throws the sweatshirt down and runs up to her room like she&#8217;s 5 years old but actually maybe you can&#8217;t even really blame her because that is a real rub-your-face-in-shit kind of a gift.</p>
<p>Steve follows DJ up to her room and asks what the big fuckin&#8217; problem is.  She says that she&#8217;s worried about the future of their relationship since he&#8217;s going to be moving so far away but he says it&#8217;s no big deal because they can still never have sex no matter where he lives.  DJ starts talking shit about the dumb party school that Steve got into and then he accuses her of buying him an expensive jacket for Christmas as a means of bribing him into staying, which makes the audience go, &#8220;oooh!&#8221;  They both get all pissed off and then Steve leaves in a huff and I can&#8217;t help but be surprised that the Christmas episode would revolve around DJ and Steve having a shitty breakup.  Also, how come they never talked before about what would happen when he left for college?</p>

<p>DJ fails to get reach Steve on the phone and then the scene is interrupted by the announcement that Joey has come out in his Santa outfit.  A ring at the doorbell reveals a second Santa, who immediately starts kissing Danny on the mouth.  Has Danny finally come out of the closet for Christmas?  It&#8217;s a holiday miracle!</p>

<p>Jesse tells Becky that he has one last surprise for her and then he takes her to the backyard, which he&#8217;s filled with snow somehow.  An even bigger miracle than his ability to control the climate in the backyard is the fact that he actually put any effort into doing something thoughtful for his wife for once.  It&#8217;s truly a Christmas miracle!  The denizens of the full house frolic in the snow out back while all the extras at the party stand around on the porch watching them and a terrible contemporary rendition of &#8220;Winter Wonderland&#8221; plays.  Merry fucking Christmas, assholes!</p>
