<p>Joey and Jesse perform a routine on their radio show called, &#8220;The Cartoons of Our Lives,&#8221; which is basically a mock radio drama with Joey doing all the voices as terrible impressions of cartoon characters.  What the fuck is this?  I thought that these guys were supposed to be playing popular music for their audience.  I can&#8217;t think of anything I would hate to listen to more when I&#8217;m stuck in traffic than what they are doing here.  If I was stuck in a car and I had to listen to this, I am absolutely positive that I would actually kill myself.</p>
<p>To top it off, Jesse performs an advertisement for a clothing store and suggests that if women can&#8217;t find the proper fit there, they should lose some weight.  Yeah, that&#8217;s right, plus-sized radio listeners!  Go fuck yourselves!  Joey gets all nervous when their boss, Alison, shows up outside of the booth because apparently he wants to bang her.  See, I told y&#8217;all that that&#8217;s what would happen if she was ever on the show again!  What other storyline could there ever be for a woman boss?  Also, I can&#8217;t believe that I didn&#8217;t catch last time that she&#8217;s played by OG MTV VJ Martha Quinn.  Thanks, comments section!  Anyway, Joey gets all nervous and starts knocking shit over.</p>

Alison excuses herself and then Joey pleads with Jesse to prove that he can be respectful towards women during the dinner so that he can fuck her.  Makes sense.</p>
<p>Stephanie buys some stupid teen magazine and reads a bunch of rules about first dates to DJ and Kimmie Gibbler.  Stephanie and Kimmie Gibbler talk hella shit to each other as Stephanie reads a bunch of idealistic dating tips that will inevitably lead to disappointment.  I think that magazines for teenage girls are probably the only thing that are as equally fucked up in the real world as they are in the full house universe.</p>
<p>Stephanie gets all dressed up for her date with Josh but he seems pretty disinterested in her romantically.  Or at least ambivalent.  Josh is a very nuanced character and it&#8217;s a little bit difficult to get a clear read on his subtle emotions.  Anyway, DJ and Steve take them to some pizza place where Steve immediately starts eating stray leftover pizza that he finds on a table.  Damn, Steve&#8217;s obsessive eating is starting to be on par with Danny&#8217;s obsessive cleaning, or Joey&#8217;s obsessive general behavior that makes you want to punch him in his stupid face.  I think that Steve&#8217;s incessant eating must be an outlet for his sexual frustration.  Anyway, Stephanie forces Josh to sit with her in a booth with Steve and DJ and then DJ tells her to fuck off.  DJ pulls Stephanie aside and Stephanie starts talking about that stupid magazine article again and how the date has to be perfect and that she needs DJ to direct her.  They go back to the booth and Stephanie tries to follow DJ&#8217;s lead, which leads to wacky mishaps.</p>

<p>Michelle, who for some reason doesn&#8217;t seem to get to eat dinner this evening, comes downstairs and starts telling Alison about how Joey said that he &#8220;has the hots&#8221; for her.  I think I mentioned this recurring routine a few reviews ago, where either Stephanie or Michelle brazenly repeats something that they clearly aren&#8217;t supposed to, much to someone else&#8217;s humiliation, and we&#8217;re all supposed to think it&#8217;s cute.  Well, here it is again.  Anyway, Alison is forced to recognize that her seemingly-asexual employee actually invited her over so he could bang her so she makes a quick attempt to excuse herself.</p>
<p>Jesse stops Alison on her way out and insists that she gives Joey a second chance.  Doesn&#8217;t this constitute sexual harassment?  Not only did her employee try to trick her into a date with him, but now her other employee is doing whatever he can to prevent her from gracefully exiting the situation.  Anyway, Jesse makes a big point about what a great guy Joey is and then, astonishingly, Alison responds by telling Jesse that she misjudged him before by reacting poorly to his constant shitty behavior and that, after being pressured into dating his unfuckable idiot friend, she now sees what a great guy Jesse is.  What the fuck is this?  Is Jesse some sort of hypnotist?  Or maybe this is another example of the full house breaking down the will of some poor, unsuspecting woman, like it did with Rebecca Donaldson.  Either way, I can no longer claim that Alison is my favorite character.</p>
