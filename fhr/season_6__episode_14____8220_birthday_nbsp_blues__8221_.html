                        <p>Pre-Credits Gag:  For some reason it&#8217;s Becky&#8217;s job to wake Michelle up for school, so she makes the twins crawl all over her.</p>

<p>Danny is all nervous about his date with Vicky for some reason even thought they have an incredibly bland relationship in which nothing remarkable ever occurs.  Stephanie comes in and complains to Joey about how she has zero plans for the evening and, surprise, surprise, he doesn&#8217;t have shit to do, either, so they decide to go see a drive-in movie.</p>

<p>Stephanie goes up to DJ&#8217;s room and ascertains that DJ is planning to hang out with Steve that evening to celebrate their 6-month anniversary and has completely forgotten that it&#8217;s Kimmie Gibbler&#8217;s 16th birthday.  Kimmie Gibbler comes in and tells DJ that she knows that she&#8217;s throwing her a surprise party but promises to act surprised anyway, then she mentions that her parents offered her a trip to Wrestlemania 6 but she passed it up for the party.  Damn, that&#8217;s the one where Hulk Hogan fought the Ultimate Warrior!  DJ is struck with guilt over her friend missing the greatest wrestling event of my childhood to attend a party that she didn&#8217;t even think about trying to plan so she decides to try to throw something together while Kimmie Gibbler goes home to change.</p>
<p>DJ rallies with Stephanie to try to figure out how to put a party together so quickly and the two of them actually seriously consider changing all of the calendars and telling Kimmie Gibbler that they went through a time warp and it&#8217;s now a month earlier.  Unfortunately, the plan that DJ ends up devising really isn&#8217;t much better.  She runs downstairs and tells everyone in the full house that they have to cancel their boring dates or lame plans or stupid craft projects or whatever to help her put a party together.  Everyone says that they do not collectively give one fuck about Kimmie Gibbler or her stupid birthday but then Vicky convinces them all to rally together to help out, seemingly because it&#8217;s way past time that her character ever did anything.</p>

<p>Danny come in and tells DJ that she has been a pretty shitty friend to Kimmie Gibbler ever since she started going out with Steve.  It&#8217;s kind of understandable, though.  I mean, DJ is a really undeveloped character, so it&#8217;s only natural that having a boyfriend would dominate most of her life and characteristics.  What else does she even have going on?  Anyway, Danny rattles on about the importance of friendship, and then he recalls that Joey and Jesse moved into the full house when he needed them, which is a weird analogy because those guys are both worthless pieces of shit who obviously only moved into the house for the free rent.  What&#8217;s most interesting about it is that, in this case, DJ is the worthless shitty friend.  If only this were the episode where Kimmie Gibbler finally accepted that DJ and her corny family are all a bunch of shitty assholes and it&#8217;s time to move on to bigger and better things.  But, no, all Kimmie Gibbler does is sit and wait in the backyard for DJ to come out and patch things up while gentle music plays.</p>
