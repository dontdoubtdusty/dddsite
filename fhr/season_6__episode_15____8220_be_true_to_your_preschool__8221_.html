<p>Meanwhile, Danny comes home and admits that Kimmie Gibbler is actually a hella good driver and so he gives her permission to take the girls out in her brother&#8217;s car.</p>
<p>Becky comes home and tells Jesse that the twins have an interview at the fancy preschool.  Jesse gets all worried because I guess he didn&#8217;t realize that his kids would have to go to an interview-much less actually attend the school-to back up his spurious claims about their mental proficiency, which in and of itself is quite a testament to what fucking dimwit stock those poor doomed twins come from.</p>
<p>As soon as they arrive at the fancy preschool, Jesse admits to Becky that he told a bunch of lies on the kids&#8217; applications.  Before she can react, they&#8217;re greeted by a representative from the school who seats them and then goes into the other room, where she sits down behind a two-way mirror with another woman and tells her, &#8220;let&#8217;s observe them through the two-way mirror to see how they relate to the children.&#8221;  Why would she need to explain that to this other woman?  Isn&#8217;t it her job to do this?  She&#8217;s already sitting behind the two-way mirror with a clipboard.  Also, what a fucking creepy thing to do.</p>

<p>Kimmie Gibbler and the girls go out cruising in her brothers car while listening to &#8220;Wild Thing&#8221; on the radio and I kept waiting for there to be a disclaimer that read, &#8220;just in case you forgot that white people have no rhythm&#8221; on the bottom of the screen while they were jamming out.  The girls spot a bunch of nerds from the chess team and decide to mock them by getting out and running in circles around their car.  Yeah, I don&#8217;t get it, either.  But the jokes on them because they lock themselves out of the car, which the nerds think is pretty funny.  Hey, I just noticed that this is like one of the only times ever that they&#8217;ve had a scene that takes place out in the city.  I&#8217;m pretty sure that this is actually L.A. though.  Anyway, the girls all sit on the curb in defeat while the car is left running in the middle of an intersection and then all of a sudden Danny pulls up on his bike.  Pretty convenient!  But not entirely implausible, as he was talking about going out for a bike ride in an earlier scene.  Never you mind that this is supposed to take place the next day.</p>
