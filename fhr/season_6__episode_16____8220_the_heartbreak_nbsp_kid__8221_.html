<p>Michelle asks Steve to marry him and he and DJ decide to go along with it because she&#8217;s just a dumb little kid who doesn&#8217;t know anything so it&#8217;s funny to toy with her emotions.</p>

The girls then head upstairs to ask Jesse about weddings and he tells them about honeymoons, which leads to a lot of sexual innuendos.  There used to be a lot more of this type of humor in the earlier Seasons but it&#8217;s kind of gone away as the show has become more bland and family-friendly, so it&#8217;s kind of nice to see some jokes about fucking again.  Anyway, Jesse shoos the girls away so he can get back to his computer work but then he discovers that the twins have erased his file.  Oh, computers!</p>

<p>Jesse comes downstairs and gets Stephanie to retrieve his lost report and when she does there&#8217;s a close-up of it and it&#8217;s actually not that bad.  There are a few typos but it&#8217;s still outstanding writing compared to any of the writing on Full House or anything you&#8217;d imagine that Jesse would be capable of composing.  My guess is that some intern wrote it.</p>

<p>Remember that episode a few Seasons back that was all about Stephanie pretending to marry her friend because she wasn&#8217;t getting enough attention from her family?  This was even more fucked up somehow.  It also draws attention to how much of a better performer 6 year old Stephanie was than 6 year old Michelle.  Actually, contrasting the two episodes does a pretty good job overall of exhibiting how much worse the show has gotten over the years.  Man, I remember shitting all over that Stephanie getting married episode back in the day.  I had no idea what was coming.  How naive I was.  How young and hopeful and naive.</p>
