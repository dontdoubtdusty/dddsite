<p>Stephanie walks into her classroom and greets the Jennifers, who were introduced in an earlier episode.  Wow, actual continuity!  One of the Jennifers is played by Topanga, which reminds me that I would bet anyone 5 dollars that every single person who has ever read this blog is going to watch &#8220;Girl Meets World&#8221; when it premiers.  Here&#8217;s to all of us, and our unsatisfying upbringing&#8217;s in the 80&#8217;s and 90&#8217;s, which we are cursed to forever relive!  Here&#8217;s to our doomed existence as slaves to sub-par pop-culture nostalgia!  Here&#8217;s to Girl Meets World, and Topanga, and angry reviews of Full House, every Friday for about another year!</p>

Joey comes home with the twins and Jesse asks them, &#8220;did you have fun with uncle Joey today,&#8221; which reminded me of all of the comments I&#8217;ve gotten over the years about how I always refer to him as Uncle Joey even though they never do on the show.  Well, they just did, so suck it.  Anyway, Joey tells the twins to show Jesse what he taught them and then they spit in his face.  Seriously, what&#8217;s with Joey and spitting in people&#8217;s faces?  Now he&#8217;s passing this behavior on?  Man, those twins have no chance of turning out to be people that can make a positive contribution to society.  None whatsoever.</p>

<p>Stephanie and Charles go up to her room to work on their reports and then Michelle walks in and tells Stephanie that she&#8217;s in hella trouble with Danny because she forgot to take the garbage out.  How come Danny didn&#8217;t mention this 30 seconds ago when he saw her himself?  After Michelle leaves, Charles starts making suggestions to Stephanie about how to cope with being hit by your parents and then she realizes that he&#8217;s routinely abused by his father.  He denies it and says that he wouldn&#8217;t admit to being abused even if she swore on her mothers life not to tell anyone and then Stephanie tells him that her mother isn&#8217;t alive and, surprisingly, the audience does not go, &#8220;aww.&#8221;</p>

<p>At school the next day, Stephanie&#8217;s teacher tells her that Charles had an accident and wont be at school for the rest of the week.  The Jennifers make jokes about it but Stephanie tells them to shut their whore mouths.  Stephanie then approaches the teacher but, remembering her vow to Charles, says nothing.</p>
<p>Michelle and Denise continue to regale the family with jokes they&#8217;ve acquired from that expensive phone number and then Jesse and Steve convene to compare notes on The Catcher in the Rye.  Steve completely fails to summarize the first half of the book and then they both realize that their proposed shortcut was idiotic and decide to read the whole book.  Thus concludes the Steve-and-Jesse-each-read-half-of-The-Catcher-in-the-Rye subplot.  Valuable lessons were learned, y&#8217;all.  Read the whole book.  That&#8217;s a hella valuable ass lesson.</p>

<p>Well, they certainly avoided any larger issues about how we live in a society that doesn&#8217;t really do anything to accommodate kids like Charles, and that his whole life is probably fucked now, but this was still the most tasteful very special episode ever.  Usually when this show tries to deal with issues it&#8217;s offensively preachy and ignorant, but this time it was merely naive.  I was actually a little bit surprised that Charles didn&#8217;t move into the full house at the end, like the time Zack Morris adopted that homeless girlfriend.  And like Zack Morris&#8217; homeless girlfriend, I&#8217;m sure that Charles will never be mentioned ever again.</p>
