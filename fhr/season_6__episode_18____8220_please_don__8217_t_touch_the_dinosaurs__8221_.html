                        <p>Pre-Credits Gag:  Michelle and the twins are bored by the children&#8217;s songs that the uncles are playing for them so the uncles switch their performance to a Reggae rendition and then they all dance.  Watching Joey sing like a Reggae guy while Jesse plays a faux-Reggae beat on his keyboards and the kids dance around made me feel like I was going straight up mentally insane.  It&#8217;s like, if I was the guy in A Clockwork Orange, this is the footage that they would make me watch while they held my eyes open.</p>

<p>DJ and Steve enter the scene, and the audience all go &#8220;woo!&#8221; and &#8220;ow!&#8221; at the sight of him, which is kind of a new thing.  They have a brief discussion about how he can&#8217;t afford to get a limo for the prom and then, seemingly incidentally, Stephanie gives him some old baseball cards from the box of leftover shit from Joey&#8217;s trunk.</p>
<p>After Steve leaves, Aunt Becky comes in with the twins and there&#8217;s yet another overly-long scene of those babies doing next to nothing until Becky looks at one of the leftover baseball cards and explains that at least one of the cards that they just gave Steve is worth hella money.  DJ and Stephanie immediately argue over who should get to claim the cash.</p>

<p>Denise asks Michelle to play tag with her and then they run around the dinosaur skeleton until Michelle clutches its leg, which knocks one of the bones loose.  The entire skeleton then begins creaking and rocking back and forth, which leads to an overly long sort of action sequence where the skeleton gradually falls apart while dramatic music plays.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, back at the full house, everyone tries to track down Steve so they can reclaim the card they gave him and sell it.  No one can agree on who should get the money and then Becky tells Joey about it, who was the cards original owner.  After some more greedy debating, Steve shows up and tells everyone that he sold the card himself.  There&#8217;s some more discussion about where the money should go, which ends pretty amicably,  and then Steve reveals that he sold the card for a mere $30.  Everyone tells him that he&#8217;s a fucking idiot because the card is worth way more than that so he decides to go shake down the kid he sold the card to.  That&#8217;s really how that storyline ends.</p>
<p>Danny, Jesse and Michelle come home and there&#8217;s a long expository argument about how Jesse has to do volunteer work at the museum for the next 10 weekends to make up for the destruction of a priceless dinosaur skeleton.  I don&#8217;t know, you guys.  Do you think that this is the most preposterous incident of them all? Who even thought of this premise?  &#8220;Michelle knocks over a dinosaur skeleton.&#8221;  I guess it&#8217;s one of the more original ideas they&#8217;ve had on this show, which kind of proves that you&#8217;re damned if you do and damned if you don&#8217;t.  Also, I can&#8217;t really pretend that I know what would happen to you if you seriously fucked up a dinosaur skeleton at a museum, but I&#8217;m pretty sure that it would be a lot worse than some volunteer work.</p>
<p>So Jesse and Danny have a heated argument about their varying approaches towards managing groups of kids, because I guess that being accountable for the destruction of a fucking dinosaur skeleton isn&#8217;t enough to make Jesse feel like he&#8217;s lost an argument, and then Michelle gets all upset and starts yelling about how it&#8217;s all her fault, then she runs upstairs, then the audience goes &#8220;aww&#8221;.</p>
<p>Jesse and Danny go up to Michelle&#8217;s room and console her by telling her that it&#8217;s not her fault that she recklessly knocked over a priceless artifact.  Jesse blames himself and says that the dinosaur got knocked over because he was such a negligent group leader and then Michelle straight up says that it is his fault and she wishes she was never in his group.  She says it in a real asshole way, too, like she can&#8217;t believe what a piece of shit he is.  See, that&#8217;s the kind of behavior you should expect from a kid that you don&#8217;t reprimand when she does something totally outlandishly terrible.  She has no moral compass whatsoever.  She is the devil.</p>

<p>Firsts:  The audience yell &#8220;whoo!&#8221; and &#8220;ow!&#8221; when Steve shows up onscreen</p>
