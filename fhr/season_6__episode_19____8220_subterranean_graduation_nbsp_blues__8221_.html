Everyone offers their support to Jesse, especially Danny, who tells him that if his speech is good, people will remember it for the rest of their lives.  I guess it&#8217;s healthy to offer support and validation to Jesse for his meager achievements, but what Danny&#8217;s saying is straight up delusional.  Maybe it would be true if Jesse threw up or something during the speech.  I&#8217;d definitely always remember seeing something like that.</p>
<p>Jesse struggles with his speech but eventually finds inspiration while watching his kids assemble an Elvis puzzle.</p>

<p>Once Jesse is ready to go, Michelle finds out that they&#8217;re going to have to take 2 cars so she dictates that they should take the Muni so they can all be together.  Naturally, everyone does what she says without question.  It would have been pretty natural and feasible if the adults had held this discussion and made this decision themselves.  Why does it have to be something that Michelle wanted to do?  Just to remind us that everyone does whatever she wants all the time?</p>
<p>They make the Muni look way too much like the New York Subway but I&#8217;ll forgive them because there&#8217;s a defaced Wake Up, San Francisco poster on the wall.</p>

<p>The Muni shuts down and the conductor comes on to tell everyone that they&#8217;re gonna be stuck there for hella long.  Jesse realizes that he&#8217;s gonna miss his graduation and then the audience goes, &#8220;aww.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the commercial break, Jesse stomps around the train and yells, not giving a fuck about all of the other people who are also on the train and also very frustrated and don&#8217;t need some yelling asshole to add to their stress.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kimmie Gibbler finishes cleaning the green paint that got all over the kitchen and then Comet pulls her into the living room where she discovers that one of the twins has gotten green paint all over everything. What a shitty babysitter.</p>

<p>Jesse mopes around because he&#8217;s missing his graduation so Danny decides that the only solution is to bother everyone on the train.  He attempts to get everyone to band together to throw Jesse an impromptu ceremony on the train but then nobody does anything.  Jesse actually acts like he recognizes that this is a stupid idea, even though he pulled the exact same shit during that terrible ass Christmas episode when they were stuck in the airport, plus that time they were stuck in a garage on Michelle&#8217;s birthday, plus probably some other corny incident that I can&#8217;t remember right now where they were stuck somewhere during an important occasion.</p>
<p>Jesse launches into a big pity parade about how everyone is gonna notice that he didn&#8217;t pick up his diploma because in his mind everyone around him is deeply concerned about everything he does all the time.  He then says that he must not be the graduating type even though he really did still graduate, he just missed the ceremony is all, and then this Keanu Reeves guy is like, &#8220;yeah, school is a bunch of bullshit.&#8221;</p>

<p>After the ceremony, the music comes on and Jesse says that graduation isn&#8217;t about people seeing you get your diploma, it&#8217;s about learning something, which I don&#8217;t really know what to make of.  If you ask me, finishing school is just about fulfilling requirements.  Anyway, Danny says that Jesse really made a difference that day and then Jesse gazes lovingly at the Keanu Reeves guy, then they give each other the dap.</p>
