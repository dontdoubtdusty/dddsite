                        <p>Well, here we go.  Season 6.  Thanks goes out to FHR fan Rachwho, who purchased these Season 6 DVD&#8217;s so we could all share in this misery instead of working hard at our jobs.  Rachwho, these next 26 weeks are all your fault.</p>

<p>A new Season brings us new changes to the opening sequence.  It&#8217;s mostly the same, except for a few choice details.  The girls&#8217; all have a new character shot for their credit, presumably because they age so conspicuously each Season. These character defining shots feature DJ whorishly applying make-up in her room, Stephanie doing an embarrassing white-people dance, and Michelle playing tug-of-war with the dog.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s also a new character in the opening, played by Scott Wienger.  Viewers of Full House might have been intrigued or even perplexed by this when it first aired, but if you&#8217;re some guy who reviews every episode of Full House each week on a blog then there are no such surprises because everyone always tells you what&#8217;s going to happen next in the comments section.  So this is Steve, DJ&#8217;s boyfriend, who I&#8217;m pretty sure is the last major character to be introduced in the series, and who was also the voice of Aladdin in that Disney cartoon.</p>

<p>Stephanie and Michelle enter the scene all excited to meet DJ at the airport as she returns from Spain.  They pour over a postcard she&#8217;s sent earlier, which promises a big surprise that their self-centered minds could only interpret as a guarantee of presents for them.</p>
<p>As the family all assemble to pick DJ up from the airport, Joey comes down with a sob story about meeting some cooze at the beach and losing her phone number.  Well, at least he&#8217;s sporting his least offensive haircut so far.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I still fucking hate that fool, but at least he&#8217;s slightly less painful to look at.</p>

<p>Kimmie Gibbler comes off of the plane first and as the family tell her to fuck off they notice a couple of teenagers doing some real gross making out right in front of the gate and then, oh shit!  One of them&#8217;s DJ!</p>

<p>Michelle spends their flight leading the other kids in a rousing chorus of &#8220;She&#8217;ll Be Comin&#8217; &#8216;Round the Mountain,&#8221; and the kids are surprisingly tone-deaf considering that they&#8217;re an international children&#8217;s choir.  One establishing shot of the San Francisco airport and some sweet saxaphone notes later, the girls are escorted off the plane by the stewardess and returned to their corny family.  The girls are surprisingly unscathed considering that they just spent over 30 hours on an airplane.  You&#8217;d think their clothes would be all drenched in sweat or they&#8217;d be visibly exhausted or something.  Or that there&#8217;d be any more information about the potentially traumatic incident that they just endured other than that they went to the gift shop in the Auckland airport.  Anyway, after being scolded by their three lame dads, the girls are taken home.</p>
<p>Back at the full house, Stephanie and Michelle lament in their room over having been grounded for a month.  DJ comes in asks them how they could be such a couple of numbskulls shitwits as to accidentally board a plane to another continent and then Stephanie says it&#8217;s all DJ&#8217;s fault for neglecting them, thus leading them to commit their most desperate, over-the-top cry for attention yet.  The music comes on as DJ explains that even though she&#8217;s gonna be getting dry humped on the couch by Aladdin all the time now, she still loves her stupid ugly sisters.  I have to say that right before this scene started I could not have told you what the music scene was going to be.  It almost seems like they ran out of time so they just stuck the DJ&#8217;s-new-boyfriend storyling and the girls-going-to-New-Zealand storylines together.  I guess it would have required two music scenes to properly address all the issues raised in this episode, although the one about Danny&#8217;s sexual possessiveness of DJ is the one that I really think needed to be dealt with.</p>
