<p>The lady cop brings everyone into the full house so she can be subjected to their grating personalities for a few minutes before Joey tries to explain himself.  He tells her that he bought the car from an old lady and is unable to provide any sort of proof of ownership.  Everyone struggles to convince the lady cop that Joey is innocent and ultimately decide that the only way to do so is to expose her to what a fucking simpleton he is.</p>

<p>Joey does what any attention starved 12-year old girl would do and puts on a big show about how nobody takes him seriously and says he&#8217;s gonna go look for an apartment.  The whole family totally buys into his bullshit behavior and immediately start showering him with emotional support, which is a real textbook example of a codependent relationship.</p>
<p>As if this episode didn&#8217;t already stand out as one of those most slapped together messes of them all, it suddenly turns into a clips show as each of the girls reminisces about what a great presence Joey has been in their lives.</p>
