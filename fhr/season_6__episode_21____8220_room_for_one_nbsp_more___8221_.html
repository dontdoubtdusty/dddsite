<p>Stephanie enters the living room and Danny asks her where Michelle is so she tells him that Michelle&#8217;s in the backyard with Scruffy.  Who&#8217;s Scruffy?  Well, Danny explains that it was nice of the girls to volunteer to watch the Davis&#8217; dog.  Who are the Davis&#8217;?  That is never explained.  Anyway, never mind that, because the real kicker is that Scruffy is actually a pig.</p>

<p>Jesse makes Becky a romantic dinner and she notices that it&#8217;s the same dinner she made him when she revealed that she was pregnant.  It&#8217;s funny that the writers on this show can remember this small detail but they can&#8217;t seem to keep track of entire characters or storylines.  Remember when Danny&#8217;s sister moved to San Francisco and started dating Joey?  It also seems feasible to me that Becky would interpret this pregnancy-news dinner as Jesse&#8217;s way of telling her that he knocked up a prostitute or something.  Seriously, how could she even be surprised if he pulled some shit like that?  I bet she wouldn&#8217;t even be mad about it and they&#8217;d just let the prostitute and the new baby live in the garage or something.  Anyway, Jesse tells Becky that he wants to have another baby and they begin to discuss it but their exchange is cut short by one of the babies calling them into the other room.</p>

<p>Describing the staging for pretty much the rest of the episode is going to be a real pain in the nuts because it&#8217;s one big convoluted cluster fuck.  Danny puts a roast in the oven as Stephanie and Michelle take Scruffy, who&#8217;s been residing in a pen in the kitchen, for a walk.  Jesse comes downstairs and hands one of the babies off to Danny while the other one, who&#8217;s sick, sleeps upstairs while they listen to him on the baby monitor.  Jesse prepares for his radio show that&#8217;s starting in 5 minutes only to discover that Joey&#8217;s out rollerblading, then Danny offers him a kiss him on the mouth.</p>

<p>Everyone runs around looking for Scruffy while Jesse makes his way upstairs to tend to his sick baby.  On his way he runs into Danny, who he asks to man the radio show for him.  Why didn&#8217;t he ask Danny to watch the sick baby instead?  Also, how come like every single person who lives in the full house is home but no one will do anything to help Jesse?  Seriously, if just one person would help him out he&#8217;d be able to host his radio show with like no problems.  Or even if Joey had just been able to do his job correctly, just this one time.</p>
<p>Danny decides to totally shit all over Jesse&#8217;s confidence in him by going on air and being a big obnoxious ham.  I know that all of these events are fictional and everything but I always think about the poor people who watch Wake Up, San Francisco or listen to the Rush Hour Renegades who are constantly subjected to content that would already be intolerable even if it wasn&#8217;t fraught with technical mishaps.  Seriously, how do any of these people still have jobs?</p>
<p>Danny puts some music on the air and then DJ, Kimmie Gibbler, Steve and some extras come down into the studio and say that they didn&#8217;t know that anyone was going to be down there and they wanted to record a rap that they wrote for the pep rally.  Oh, god damn it.  After all I&#8217;ve been through already, am I really going to have to listen to these honkeys rap?</p>

The rap routine is utter fucking chaos, so much so that even the characters on the show recognize that it sucks, but anyway it&#8217;s all just so that Danny can accidentally put it on the air so the radio show can suck even more than it already did.</p>
<p>Jesse hears his radio show completely going to shit so he puts his kid back in his crib and makes his way down to the studio.  On his way he sees the pig and is able to lure him back into his pen.  Jesse goes into the studio and is able to gain control for a few seconds before Michelle and Stephanie run downstairs and exclaim that the pig has been found.  Seriously, doesn&#8217;t one person in this house give a shit that they&#8217;re trying to record a radio show down there?</p>
<p>So then the roast that Danny put into the oven earlier starts burning and Scruffy escapes from his pen and heads into the basement.  The radio show is disrupted even further as everyone runs around trying to catch the pig and then they finally grab him and bring him upstairs.  Up in the kitchen everyone discovers that Danny&#8217;s roast had caught fire so they all decide that Scruffy came downstairs to warn them and that he is a hero.</p>

<p>Later that evening, Becky comes home looking super fine in her reporter miniskirt and then, as Jesse greets her, the music comes on and he admits that he&#8217;s a big fuck up that can&#8217;t handle all of the responsibilities he&#8217;s taken on.  Becky says that she&#8217;s decided not to take the reporter job because holding that baby made her realize that she&#8217;s ready to crank out another one, plus at this point doing whatever Jesse wants all the time has become pretty routine, especially if it involves ruining all of her hopes and dreams.</p>
