<p>The episode opens just seconds after the conclusion of the pre-credits gag, when DJ enters the living room with Steve and Kimmie Gibbler as they prepare to go shopping for prom dresses.  They deliver some expository dialogue as they make their way to the front door and it is revealed that Kimmie Gibbler is going to the prom with some guy that Steve fixed her up with and Jesse and his shitty band are going to be performing there.  Of course they are!</p>

<p>As Becky applies whoreish makeup to DJ&#8217;s big round moon face, she reminisces about her own prom and states with disbelief that she&#8217;s now old enough to be chaperoning at DJ&#8217;s.  So, Becky&#8217;s chaperoning at DJ&#8217;s prom, huh?  Of course she is!</p>
<p>DJ mentions that she and Steve were invited to an after-party in a hotel room and Becky supports her unwillingness to ever do anything that&#8217;s fun.  DJ worries that Steve&#8217;s still into his old girlfriend and Becky reassures her that Steve is only into stick-in-the-mud girls who never put out and have corny, overbearing families.</p>
<p>The audience does an awful lot of hooting as everyone comes out in their prom attire.  Becky and Jesse are all dudded up for their respective chaperone/band member roles, Steve shows up in a fly ass tuxedo, and DJ looks pretty bangin&#8217; in her dress.</p>

<p>Kimmie Gibbler&#8217;s date refers to her as, &#8220;my little love stick.&#8221; I cant really figure out what that&#8217;s supposed to mean but I think it might be disgusting.  Becky tries to hang out with the kids because the other chaperones don&#8217;t want to join her as she dances to her husband&#8217;s shitty music and also because there&#8217;s a running gag this episode about her feeling old and attempting to cling to her youth.</p>

<p>So then they announce the prom queen and, oh snap!  It&#8217;s Steve&#8217;s ex-girlfriend.  I&#8217;m kind of surprised that Jesse didn&#8217;t just say it was DJ because it&#8217;s not like he hasn&#8217;t tampered with every other event he&#8217;s been involved in throughout the entire series by making it all about his stupid family but I guess that it better serves the formulaic plot if Steve&#8217;s ex-girlfriend wins.  The camera zooms in on DJ as sad music plays while the prom king and queen accept their awards.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, back at the full house, everyone tries to teach the babies the proper way to eat ice cream without looking like a fucking slob and then Joey unintentionally exemplifies the wrong way to do it.  Of course he does!</p>

<p>Becky pulls Jesse off of the stage and has him go over to the elevator to stop DJ, Steve and the passive participants that they&#8217;re using to spite each other before they can head up to the party.</p>
<p>Jesse pulls everyone out of the elevator and asks them what the fuck is going on.  They convince DJ that she should never ever go to a fun party, even if it&#8217;s just to get revenge on her shitty boyfriend, and then DJ says that the prom is ruined and her whole life sucks.</p>
