                        <h1>Season 6, Episode 23, &#8220;The House Meets the Mouse-Part&nbsp;1&#8221;</h1>

                        <p>Pre-Credits Gag:  Jesse puts the twins to bed and then goes out to the main room to fuck Aunt Becky.  It&#8217;s pretty weird to me how the show has been totally indiscreet about them having sex lately.  I guess it&#8217;s supposed to be ok because they&#8217;re married.  It&#8217;s also a really weird way to start a 2-part episode about going to Disney World.  Anyway, the twins interrupt them.</p>

<p>Anyway, Vicky leaves in a hurry and kisses everyone goodbye except for Danny.  Even Steve and Kimmie Gibbler get a smooch!</p>

<p>Jesse tells Becky that his terrible band got a gig at Disney World.  Hey, sure, why not?  Becky says that it&#8217;s kind of a bummer that he&#8217;ll be out of town for their anniversary but he tells her that he wants her to go with him, which she finds quite touching.  They negotiate about what to do with the twins and then decide to bring them along and then Joey comes upstairs and says that he&#8217;s coming, too, and that they&#8217;re going to be doing their radio show from Disney World, plus a live broadcast of Jesse&#8217;s terrible concert.  Jesse seems like he doesn&#8217;t really want Joey to go but since when has Joey ever cared about being a welcome addition to anything?  Then the rest of the family come upstairs and say that they&#8217;re all going, too.  Stephanie explains that there&#8217;s a school vacation the next week and Wake Up, San Francisco is in reruns so Danny decided to take everyone to Disney World.  Well that&#8217;s pretty god damn convenient.  Even Kimmie Gibbler is going, because apparently her parents are willing to pay for her to go on an expensive vacation just so they can get rid of her for a while.  That&#8217;s actually really sad.</p>
<p>Despite all the hoopla, Jesse is unhappy about the rest of the family coming along because he really wanted to bang his wife throughout the entire vacation and DJ is sad because she&#8217;s gonna miss Steve hella bad.  But anyway, who cares?  The Tanners are going to Disney World!</p>

<p>So anyway, here we go:  the most obnoxious family on Earth find themselves at the happiest place on Earth.  The first thing that happens is that they run into people in Donald Duck and Goofy costumes as they exit the hotel.  I&#8217;ve always been a little confused about those people in the suits at theme parks.  Are little kids supposed to believe that those are the actual characters?  I got to go to Disneyland a few times when I was a little kid and I sure as shit never had any illusions about them being anything other than people in suits.  It&#8217;s not like I ever thought that Mickey Mouse was real anyway, and even if I did, I&#8217;d assume that he could move his mouth and talk and stuff, and that his head wasn&#8217;t made out of a hard plastic material.  But I have to wonder, if those people in suits aren&#8217;t there to create an illusion for children, why are they there at all?</p>

<p>After a rendition of &#8220;Zippity Doo Dah&#8221; with some some rockin&#8217; guitar licks in it plays over some more stock footage, the girls approach the Magic Castle and gaze in awe at what an amazing place to visit Disney World is.  It kind of makes you want to save up all of your money all year so you can take your family there, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>

Joey sits in the guys little animation cubicle and starts dicking around with his supplies until he creates a stylized rendition of himself, because I guess that Joey has been an adroit cartoonist all this time and it was never mentioned before.</p>

<p>Danny and Vicky eat at some underwater-themed restaurant and he tries to propose again before being interrupted by the uncles, who are swimming around in the tank for some reason even though they&#8217;re supposed to be doing their radio show.  It&#8217;s probably for the better anyway, because a spontaneous proposal in an underwater-themed restaurant sounds like a pretty darn lousy way to go if you ask me.</p>
