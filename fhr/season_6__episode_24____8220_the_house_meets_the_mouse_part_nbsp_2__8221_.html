                        <hr>
                        <p>After last week&#8217;s cliff-hanger ending with Michelle wandering off at Disney World, this week&#8217;s episode opens with her dancing in front of a calypso band like some sort of creepy little goblin while a crowd of people watches.  So that&#8217;s where she went!  None of the guys in the band seem to mind that she&#8217;s there, presumably because they&#8217;re high out of their minds.  I don&#8217;t know why the audience is cool with it.  She asks one of the band members if they think she&#8217;s bossy and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;no way,&#8221; then he gets everyone in the audience to applaud her.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Becky waits for Jesse on the dock like a sucker while Chip and Dale mock her for having such a shitty husband. You know what I&#8217;ve always wondered?  Chip and Dale dancers are those erotic male dancers who keep their bow ties on when they strip&#8230; so why do they share the same namesake as these cartoon chipmunks?  And which one came first?</p>

<p>Snow White brings Michelle to her tea party but then sad music plays as Michelle says that she wants her wish back because she&#8217;s sad that her family isn&#8217;t there.  After the commercial break, Mickey Mouse arrives at the tea party with all of the Tanners in tow.  Danny actually gets pretty mad and tells Michelle that she freaked everybody out and that they&#8217;re going to have a long talk later.  Michelle protests that nobody would do what she told them to but then Vicky explains that good princesses are fair and kind and don&#8217;t just act like totally spoiled pieces of shit all the time.  Then they all have a tea party.</p>

Anyway, she instantly forgives him and then they make out on a little boat.</p>
<p>While the family all gather to watch an Aladdin-themed parade, some camel statues spit into the crowd and hit Danny right in the face.  Well, at least it wasn&#8217;t Joey doing it for once.</p>

<p>After the show, Danny asks Michelle what she wants to do next and then Stephanie says that she&#8217;s gonna go back to the hotel to chill out and it&#8217;s pretty evident that it&#8217;s because she&#8217;s sick of Michelle&#8217;s stupid ugly face.  The rest of the family head off to enjoy a montage of fun rides without her.</p>

This perfectly aligns with the central moral lesson of Full House: anyone who chooses to do the right thing will instantly be rewarded with whatever they want.</p>

<p>Bringing this 2-part monstrosity to a climax, Jesse&#8217;s shitty band have their concert in front of a large crowd of people who probably thought they were there to see Sting or something.  Instead they&#8217;re forced to endure a horrible cover of, &#8220;The Hippy Hippy Shake.&#8221;</p>
