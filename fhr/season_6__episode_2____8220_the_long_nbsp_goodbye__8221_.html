                        <p>Pre-Credits Gag:  Joey and the new ugly babies are playing with bubbles and then the O.G. ugly baby, Michelle, comes up and says that she&#8217;s too old for bubbles now.  Joey shoots her in the face with a bubble gun until she decides that bubbles are fun again and then they all have a bubble party.</p>

With that, we have established this exciting new characters primary characteristic.  His name is Steve, and he eats a lot of food.</p>

<p>Teddy comes over to say goodbye to Michelle but she convinces him to hang out for a little while first.  Meanwhile, Jesse buys a bunch of masculine toys for his kids because he&#8217;s so threatened by them playing with dolls.  Becky comes upstairs after finding the doll stuffed in the hamper and delivers a surprisingly thoughtful speech about why it&#8217;s ok for little boys to play with dolls, like they learn to be compassionate and sensitive and all that shit.  As if that glimmer of sensibility wasn&#8217;t surprising enough, Jesse actually fucking listens to her and does what she says!  Can you believe it?!!?  I took a big shit right in my pants when it happened, I was so surprised.</p>

I really prefer homosexual-allusions Danny to unconvincing-heterosexual Danny.</p>
