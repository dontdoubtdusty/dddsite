<p>DJ, Steve and Kimmie Gibbler all come downstairs and Steve immediately starts eating all of the food.  He grabs a bunch of new groceries that Joey just bought and then he just leaves, which seems pretty odd to me.  I mean, if he wants to stick around and finger bang DJ after he eats the food, that&#8217;s one thing, but to hit it and quit it like that?  Seems a little disrespectful to me.  Anyway, Danny asks the girls about school and Kimmie Gibbler says that she&#8217;s running for class president and DJ says that she&#8217;s auditioning for the school paper, even though she&#8217;s already been on the school paper for like years.  Ok, so maybe that was when she was in junior high and she&#8217;s in high school now (I honestly don&#8217;t remember), but even still, who the fuck ever has to audition for a school newspaper?</p>
<p>Jesse gets a call from Fat Fish Records informing him that his shitty ass cover of &#8220;Forever&#8221; is the #1 song in Japan.  They want to fly him and his family out there for 2 weeks to do promotional stuff so Becky asks Danny if he can cover for her on their show for the next few weeks with no notice and he&#8217;s just like, &#8220;sure, no problem.&#8221;  I feel like they shouldn&#8217;t address these kinds of practical concerns at all if they&#8217;re going to resolve them in such a thoughtless manner.</p>
<p>Michelle makes a hideous face that makes the audience go, &#8220;aww,&#8221; when she finds out that Jesse will be going away for a while, but then he promises to send her letters and buy her presents and so she feels reasonably accommodated.</p>

<p>As Michelle anticipates a call from Uncle Jesse, she asks Stephanie a bunch of questions about how far away Japan is.  At this point in the series, these two characters don&#8217;t really have very discernible personalities from one another.  They&#8217;re both just totally bitchy wise asses with horrible butt faces.</p>

<p>The representative from Fat Fish Records tells Becky that they want Jesse to tour Asia for an entire year, spreading his terrible covers of songs that weren&#8217;t even that good in the first place across a once-proud land.  Becky addresses the offer to Jesse with some concern and then-wait, I&#8217;m sorry, I just noticed that the promotional poster of Jesse that&#8217;s in his dressing room is from that episode where he got stuck hanging from some cables while he was performing at the Smash Club.  I guess that we can assume that there were photographers at the Smash Club that night, but even still, that was like a disaster of a performance.  It was also an occasion when Jesse was putting on a phony image to try to appeal to more people, which he ultimately decided was wrong, so why would there be pictures of it around?  Wait a minute, why am I actually thinking about this?  Oh my God you guys I&#8217;m so ashamed that I even noticed that.  Fuck watching this show, you guys.  My brain is just totally awful now.</p>

<p>Becky eventually walks out on Jesse, leaving him in his room to have a heart-to-heart talk with Koji about the importance of family or something.  Jesse runs to catch Becky but finds her waiting for him in the hallway and then the music comes on as he says that he&#8217;s going to quit the tour to be with his family.  Becky tells him that he doesn&#8217;t need to give up everything, he just needs to stop being such an asshole and expecting whatever kind of fancy peanuts he wants, but it doesn&#8217;t really matter because it&#8217;s not like they&#8217;re ever going to follow up on this storyline anyway.  Jesse and Becky make up and then Jesse excuses Koji so he can fuck his wife but first the two men show their respect by bowing first, and then exchanging handshakes, representing a beautiful unity between east and west that could only be forged by a terrible cover of Beach Boys song.</p>
