<p>Stephanie wont let Michelle help her with the short story she&#8217;s writing, so Michelle feels sorry for herself and the audience goes, &#8220;aww.&#8221;  Such heavy-handed emotional pandering, not 3 minutes into the episode?  That might be a record.  Anyway, Stephanie reads her story to everyone and they all agree that it sucks dick.  Becky suggests that Stephanie writes about something she knows and then Steve, DJ and Kimmie Gibbler all walk in as DJ busts Steve&#8217;s balls about giving Kathie Santoni a ride home.  I&#8217;ve gotta back DJ on this one.  Kathy Santoni has big titties and is loose with boys.  Steve should not be driving her home.</p>

<p>Back at the full house, Joey tells Jesse that his humiliating experience on the Ranger Joe show has taught him not to be such an antagonistic asshole.  The music comes on again as they rekindle their flaming boners for one another and agree to start a new career as radio DJ&#8217;s.  Hey, that&#8217;s two musics in a single episode.  What the fuck?  Was that first lesson not valuable enough or something?  I also find it pretty irritating how these two worthless pieces of shit can just stumble their way through life, ending up in one successful career after another.  I bet Jesse could take a shit in a public toilet and then get hired to be the official public toilet shitter of San Francisco or something.  What a tremendous insult to every hardworking person on the planet.</p>
