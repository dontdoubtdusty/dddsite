<p>Steve leaves for wrestling practice and Vicky leads the two youngest, ugliest girls into the kitchen so Danny can yell at DJ.  He lectures her about what a fuck up she&#8217;s been since she started going out with Steve and then he straight up loses his mind when she defends herself by saying that they&#8217;re in love.</p>

<p>Danny shows up at Steve&#8217;s wrestling practice to ask him if he knows where DJ ran off to.  Steve is pretty friendly and cooperative but Danny still tells him that he&#8217;s not allowed to see DJ anymore.  Steve pleads with him but then has to tend to his wrestling practice obligation so his coach wont get all pissed.  Danny, being a denizen of the full house, is totally unwilling to wait until Steve has time to talk, and so he convinces Steve&#8217;s wrestling partner to switch out with him.  The staging of this is particularly awkward because Steve is supposed to be unaware of what&#8217;s happening but the exchange between Danny and the other kid isn&#8217;t really that brief, so Steve&#8217;s just kind of hanging out in his wrestling pose looking down at the ground for a really long time.  And that&#8217;s not to even mention the most fucked up part about what&#8217;s going on here, which is that a god damn 35 year old man just walked into a High School wrestling practice and started wrestling one of the kids.  Grown men are seriously not allowed to do that. If Steve&#8217;s wrestling coach is supposed to be keeping such a stern eye on him, why would he allow this to happen?</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s bring a little levity to this otherwise somber drama by watching Jesse totally fuck up on his first day as a radio DJ.  Apparently he took a shitload of cold medicine before the show, leaving Joey to handle everything while he sleeps.  I feel like I&#8217;ve been ragging on Jesse for his contemptible lack of a work ethic for years now, and yet here we find ourselves, at a brand new low.  Not only is he sleeping through his very first day at work, but he pawned all of his responsibilities off on Joey, the sorriest piece of shit on Earth.</p>

<p>Danny sits in the backyard, thinking hard about how he&#8217;s going to prevent DJ from growing up or having a life of her own.  A chastity belt?  Maybe some sort of enchanted tower?  Vicky comes out and is like, &#8220;Jesus Christ, Danny, I know that I&#8217;m painfully uninteresting and everything, but I&#8217;m only on this show every couple of episodes.  Can&#8217;t you stop running your daughters life for like 30 seconds so we can get some Chinese food or something?&#8221;  Danny says that DJ&#8217;s just some dumb ass kid who doesn&#8217;t know shit about love and then Vicky starts asking him about their own relationship.  The music comes on, which makes Danny realize that they are in love, a revelation which leads to some really awkward kissing and then some non-sexual hugging that&#8217;s slightly less awkward to watch.  So there you go, guys, Danny and Whatsername are in love now.</p>

<p>Then Danny drops some actually practical dad knowledge about balancing your life and not letting no man tell you how to be and then DJ and Danny talk about how rad it is to be in love.  In the final moments, they hug about love and then the audience goes, &#8220;aww&#8221; again, all while the music plays.</p>
