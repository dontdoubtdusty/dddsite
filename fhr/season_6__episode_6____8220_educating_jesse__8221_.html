                        <p>Pre-Credits Gag:  Pretty much all of the pre-credits gags now have to do with someone in the full house doing something with the twins before Michelle comes in and says some dumb ass nonsense.  This time it&#8217;s Joey.</p>

<p>Michelle tells Stephanie to tie her shoes and Stephanie&#8217;s like, &#8220;bitch, it&#8217;s time for you to learn to tie your own muthafuckin shoes.&#8221;  Danny comes in and tries to teach her a shoelace tying song but before he can get very far, Stephanie starts debating the specifics of the instructional lyrics.</p>

At least I think that&#8217;s what happened.  I was too distracted by the hair.</p>

<p>Ok, so let&#8217;s just go ahead and address how totally ridiculous this scenario is.  First of all, we&#8217;ve already seen Jesse attend his high school reunion, in an episode that included a flashback that took place one week before he graduated, no less.  So how are you gonna try to tell me that he never graduated?  But, hey, let&#8217;s just go ahead and acknowledge that I&#8217;m some weirdo who writes about every episode of this shitty show, so maybe normal people who watched this shit wouldn&#8217;t bother to remember something like that.  Hey, it&#8217;s ok, I get it.  So how about we turn this into a basic logic problem, where based on everyone&#8217;s ages we can determine that Jesse would have been in high school at the time that Danny married his sister, so how would Danny not know about Jesse dropping out?  It&#8217;s not like these people were respecting each others privacy in the past.  But, hey, let&#8217;s just assume that Jesse has been keeping it a secret from everybody somehow, just to keep this going.  Why would that prevent him from telling kids to stay in school?  Does he fundamentally believe that kids should not stay in school, or are we supposed to accept that he has some sort of a conscience in this one particular instance?  It&#8217;s not like being a terrible musician has ever stopped him from calling himself a musician.  I don&#8217;t buy it, you guys.  This whole scenario is nonsense.</p>

<p>Becky asks Jesse to explain the gigantic plot hole of him being a high school dropout and he starts to tell her about a teacher he had named Mr. Pearson.  Apparently Mr. Pearson was a real ball buster, and he shamed Jesse so greatly when he was unable to recite, &#8220;Oh Captain, My Captain,&#8221; that Jesse excused himself to go to the bathroom and never came back.  Becky explains that it&#8217;s pretty easy to make up a single high school class if that&#8217;s all you need to get your diploma and urges him to go to night school so he can become a slightly less humiliating trophy husband.  Jesse struggles with the idea but since neither of them consider that he could just take a GED test, he finally decides to go back to school.  Congratulatory hugs follow.</p>

<p>Jesse comes downstairs on his way to night school, which would have been really confusing if Steve hadn&#8217;t asked about him earlier.  Jesse tells everyone that he memorized &#8220;Oh Captain, My Captain&#8221; in anticipation for his first day back at school and then everyone tells him that they&#8217;re really proud of him because that&#8217;s what you tell a sorry ass loser when he&#8217;s trying to achieve some meager pathetic goal.</p>
<p>One of the other students in Jesse&#8217;s class recognizes him from Jesse and the Rippers, which prompts Jesse to get up and demonstrate some of his stage moves.  He&#8217;s so involved in his demonstration that he pays the teacher no mind when he comes into the classroom, but once Jesse sees who it is he&#8217;s quite dismayed.  Hey guys, before I move on, I want you to guess who Jesse&#8217;s teacher is.  No, really, guess.  Who could it possibly be?</p>

<p>Back at the full house, Michelle tries to hold her shoelaces together with bubblegum and Danny tells her that she&#8217;d better keep practicing her shoe tying.  DJ and Kimmie Gibbler can&#8217;t agree on a stay-in-school slogan so they make everyone vote on whose is better.  Everyone picks DJ&#8217;s, which makes it seem kind of unfair that the voting is entirely determined by DJ&#8217;s family.  Actually, the only person that doesn&#8217;t pick DJ&#8217;s slogan is Steve, presumably because he had nothing to lose.  It&#8217;s not like DJ can get mad and withhold all those blow jobs she never gives him.</p>
<p>Jesse comes home and tells the whole family that he hates school and he&#8217;s never going back.  Never!  As he&#8217;s heading upstairs to cry and not take care of his children, he finds Michelle throwing all of her shoes into the hallway.</p>

<p>Firsts:  Apparently we&#8217;re supposed to believe that Jesse never graduated from high school</p>
