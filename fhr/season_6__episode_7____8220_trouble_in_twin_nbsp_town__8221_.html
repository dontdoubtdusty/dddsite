<p>Becky tells Jesse that her cousin Dick is coming to town with his wife so they can enter their twin daughters in the favorite twin contest.  Jesse says that he hates Dick&#8217;s stupid guts but Becky tells him tough shit because they&#8217;re all having dinner together that night.</p>
<p>Stephanie asks DJ and Steve what to do about this boy at school who&#8217;s harassing her and they say that he probably likes her and she should call him.  It sounds like this boy is being pretty abusive, and I get how they reach the conclusion that he&#8217;s doing it because he likes Stephanie and doesn&#8217;t know how to express it, but I don&#8217;t really understand why they would encourage her to try to get into a relationship with this problematic young man.</p>

<p>Stephanie tells DJ that it didn&#8217;t go very well when she called that boy who was harassing her and then DJ offers some more inept advice.  Meanwhile, Michelle tries to entertain Cousin Larry&#8217;s twin daughters but they&#8217;re so unimpressed by the fact that she doesn&#8217;t own a Laserdisc player that they ignore her and bust out their Atari Lynx&#8217;s.</p>
