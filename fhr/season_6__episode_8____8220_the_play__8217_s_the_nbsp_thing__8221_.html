That pretty much summarizes this entire series.</p>
<p>Speaking of throwbacks to the early days, this episode opens with Jesse eating a big ass piece of fried chicken while he and Joey prepare for their radio show.  Remember when he used to eat fried chicken in pretty much every episode?  He eats it way less often now.  That&#8217;s about as close as we ever get to character development on this show.</p>

<p>Becky asks Jesse if he can watch the twins but he says that he has to leave for work and then he kisses them goodbye while the audience goes &#8220;aww&#8221;.  Becky is routinely unphased by his refusal to help and then gladly accepts Danny&#8217;s offer to watch them.</p>
<p>DJ and Steve come home and Michelle asks them if they&#8217;ll come to her school play and DJ&#8217;s like, &#8220;fuck yeah we will.&#8221;  DJ shares that she played the role of Yankee Doodle when her 1st grade class performed the same play that Michelle&#8217;s class is doing, &#8220;America the Beautiful.&#8221;  Stephanie recalls that she also played Yankee Doodle, which convinces Michelle that she has to play that part herself.</p>

<p>So Jesse, Joey and Stephanie set to work on ruining the 1st grade play but, hey, at least Aaron Bailey&#8217;s involved!  Aaron Bailey&#8217;s the shit, you guys!  He&#8217;s the realest motherfucker in the entire full house universe!</p>

<p>Becky is weirded out by Danny spending so much time with her kids, probably because she&#8217;s unfamiliar with the behavior of a proactive male partner.  Michelle comes home all pissed and the uncles explain to Danny that this super flamboyant gay kid auditioned and the rules of theater dictated that he had to be cast as the lead.  I can&#8217;t really blame Michelle for not understanding the uncles&#8217; choice, as nepotism seems to be a deeply ingrained practice in the full house.  Who are either of the uncles to deny Danny&#8217;s kids anything when they&#8217;ve been suckling at his proverbial teat and scoring jobs off of him left and right for years?</p>
<p>The uncles cast Michelle as the Statue of Liberty so she can still be heavily featured in the play but it&#8217;s not enough to satisfy her.  She&#8217;s a real shithead during rehearsal and Jesse is surprisingly unwilling to accommodate her so she just goes and sits in the auditorium while making a real snide face.</p>

<p>Michelle gives the uncles the cold shoulder so they try to explain to her that she&#8217;s being a real bag of dicks and she should just shut the fuck up and play the statue of liberty already.  Michelle tries to explain why she&#8217;s upset and in doing so delivers the most incredible line reading I&#8217;ve ever seen.  You kind of have to see it for yourself to get the full effect, but it goes like this, &#8220;I want to be Yankee Doode&#8230; because Stephanie and DJ&#8230; were.  Yankee Doodle, and I want to be Yankee Doodle, too.&#8221;  I can&#8217;t tell if her reading is so stilted and dreamlike because she can&#8217;t remember her lines or because her acting coach is feeding them to her from offstage, but either way I can&#8217;t help but think that it may have helped her sound more natural if she didn&#8217;t have to say &#8220;Yankee Doodle&#8221; 3 times in 10 seconds.  Regardless, I find it pretty amazing that a show this popular and lucrative couldn&#8217;t get their shit together to produce even one halfway decent take.  That is seriously the worst line reading in the history of television.</p>

<p>Steve shows up at Michelle&#8217;s play after apparently not speaking with DJ for several days and then they patch up their dumb ass arbitrary disagreement.  The 1st grade play begins and it&#8217;s a fucking disaster.  Aaron Bailey fucks up all his lines and Denise&#8217;s wig comes off, all while Joey stands offstage, being worthless.  Derek pusses out when his cue comes on and the whole play comes to a halt.  Michelle walks offstage and the music comes on as she delivers some inspiring words to Derek about not fucking up the play by being a punk ass bitch.  The play starts up again and Derek finally delivers his flamboyant showmanship to the stage.  He sings &#8220;Yankee Doodle&#8221; and makes a point to incorporate Michelle into his performance because we all know by now that the big moral of this show is that any act of virtue or generosity will immediately be rewarded.</p>
