<p>Joey promotes a hockey game that he&#8217;ll be playing in for charity, which I&#8217;m pretty sure is the first time that there&#8217;s ever been any mention of him playing hockey.  Jesse adds that he&#8217;ll be the announcer for the game and then Joey points out that Jesse knows fuck all about the game of hockey.  Jesse seems pretty unperturbed by this, as he&#8217;s been coasting his whole life on good looks and other peoples&#8217; success and has never bothered to be good at anything.</p>
<p>The uncles bring on their first guest, a sponsor for the event named Hirschel Binkley, who is also going to be the goalie for the team opposing Joey.  Hirschel Binkley expresses a familiarity with Joey but after he isn&#8217;t recognized, he busts out his old hockey mask, revealing that he is in fact Stonewall Binkley, Joey&#8217;s old hockey rival from college.</p>

<p>DJ continues to ride Danny&#8217;s ass about letting her drive on the freeway until he finally caves in.  Stephanie&#8217;s comes downstairs, trailed by Michelle, who refuses to come all the way down because she&#8217;s still scared of the Norwegian Goat Boy.  Yes, this is a real premise on this show.  Danny fails to convince her that the Goat Boy isn&#8217;t real but Stephanie manages to assure her that the Goat Boy doesn&#8217;t have any way to reach San Francisco.</p>
<p>Jesse and Joey come home and Joey decides just as he walks into the scene that he&#8217;s not going to play at the charity event after all.  Everyone thinks that Joey should still play but they all agree to support his pussy ass decision regardless.</p>
<p>The family all try to ease the shame of Joey being a punk bitch by taking a recreational trip to the ice skating rink together.  Jesse is as bad at ice skating as he is at everything else he does in life, which provides a lot of physical comedy.</p>

<p>Danny bombards DJ with anal retentive driving regulations right before letting her drive on the freeway for the first time and then Steve comes over to be supportive by coming along for the ride.  Meanwhile, Jesse allows his children to crawl all over him while he tries to read the rules of hockey so he can be terrible at both fatherhood and his radio career at the same time.</p>

<p>Even though that last moment really seemed to be played up for laughs, the next scene begins with Joey going upstairs to console Michelle.  He finds her hiding under her bed and then the music comes on as he tries to make her understand that he&#8217;s not really mean and scary, he&#8217;s just trying to get all amped up to play some sports.  Wait, what am I even watching here?  What is the lesson exactly?  The problem seemed to be that she kept getting freaked out by these fictional creatures but somehow that means that Joey can&#8217;t behave aggressively when he plays sports?  What is the connection there exactly?  I get that it would be jarring to see a guy that&#8217;s never expressed any real emotions and who talks like cartoon characters half the time get all confrontational, but she can&#8217;t just control his behavior like that.  You know what I think would be the best solution to this problem?  If he finally moved out of that fucking house.  It made a lot more sense back in the early Seasons when he was just some unemployed amateur comedian, but he&#8217;s had a couple of real jobs now and it&#8217;s really just time to move on.  It&#8217;s the best thing for everyone.  But no real plausible solutions to the deeply-rooted dysfunctions that dwell withing the full house are ever presented, only shallow quick-fixes, and so Joey does a Kermit the Frog impression and promises never to be mean ever again.  Hugs.</p>

<p>So Joey does a shitty job at hockey because he can&#8217;t hurt anyone while Michelle sits on the sidelines, looking all freaked out.</p>

<p>Becky comes into Jesse&#8217;s booth and does his announcing for him because that&#8217;s the way their marriage works.  Danny enters the bleachers with DJ and Steve and tells everyone that DJ got a ticket for driving too slow on the freeway.  Joey continues to suck shit at hockey and then heads to the sidelines for halftime.  Michelle appears from pretty much out of nowhere and he pleads with her to let him play more aggressively.  Hey, wait a minute, they already had a talk over the music about this, but it didn&#8217;t fix anything.  Damn, you guys, the music didn&#8217;t resolve the problem this time!  Everything I ever knew was a lie!</p>
