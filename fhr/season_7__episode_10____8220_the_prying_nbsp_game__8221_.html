<p>At the library, Stephanie notices Steve and then watches from behind some books as a woman comes up to him to discuss plans they have for later in the evening and then kisses his cheek.  Stephanie observes this with a somber expression as dramatic music plays.</p>

Anyway, Kimmie Gibbler notices that Stephanie is upset and then Stephanie tells her that she saw Steve at the library with another girl.  They decide that they&#8217;d better investigate further before telling DJ what&#8217;s going on and agree to set aside their differences until the matter is settled.</p>
<p>All the dads come home and tell Becky about how they&#8217;ve booked time on the station&#8217;s home shopping show (I&#8217;m assuming that they mean the station that airs Wake Up, San Francisco, but, again, there&#8217;s not a lot of information provided and you have to sort of work things out for yourself) and she makes the very reasonable observation that they haven&#8217;t even manufactured the device yet.  They respond by doing what they always do, which is to totally steamroll over any reasonable thinking and continue on with their ridiculous plan.</p>

<p>Stephanie and Kimmie Gibbler finally decide to leave the apartment but then Steve and DJ come back at that precise moment so they go back to hiding behind the counter again.  The woman in the towel comes out, now fully dressed, and it&#8217;s revealed that she&#8217;s actually Steve&#8217;s cousin, Edie.</p>

They live in the same house.</p>
<p>Down at the TV station, everyone prepares for the infomercial or whatever it is.  OK, so, how many disastrous TV recordings have we seen on this show over the years?  I bet that I could tell you pretty much everything that&#8217;s about to happen without even watching it.  It would involve a lot of flailing around and missed cues and a generally unprofessional presentation.  There has literally never been a single incident of something being filmed in this entire series that wasn&#8217;t a complete fucking disaster.  And yet, here we are, about to see it happen all over again.  Well, shit.</p>
<p>Jesse shows Becky the sound effects machine that he&#8217;s brought for the recording so she can overlay applause or laughter at appropriate points.  He makes sure to label the buttons so she doesn&#8217;t mix them up with all of the other sound effects that it also makes, none of which are about to play into the inevitable upcoming hijinx, I&#8217;m sure.  Keep in mind that all Becky has to do here is remember where two buttons are.</p>
<p>So the taping begins and the most prevalent joke is that every time they mention the device, which is called the Sprayguard 2001, they say &#8220;Sprayguard two-thousand&#8230;and one!&#8221; which isn&#8217;t even really a joke.  But you know what?  They say it ten million fucking times.  You know how sometimes you&#8217;ll see a bit on TV and at first it&#8217;ll be funny and then they keep doing it and it stops being funny but then it goes even further and it becomes funny again?  Well, this isn&#8217;t like that at all.  This bit isn&#8217;t funny and then continues to not be funny and then it just makes you want to kill yourself.</p>
