                        <p>Pre-Credits Gag:  The twins dress like cowboys and ride plastic rocking horses.  Also, they’ve taken to calling their parents by their first names (remember this, as it is a crucial plot element).</p>

<p>Danny tries to keep Marcia Wallace in the living room as she explains to him that 3 new bike thefts have just occurred and she wants to set up Crime Catcher headquarters in the full house.  Becky sees all the bikes in the kitchen and asks the uncles what the fuck is going on and then they have to take the bikes upstairs because Kimmie Gibbler shows up at the back door.  Becky deals with Kimmie Gibbler as she sets up a bunch of crime solving equipment in the kitchen and then one of the twins comes down and calls his mom Becky, which is a throwback to the pre-credits gag for those of you that have been paying close attention.</p>
<p>DJ, Steve and Stephanie come home with a bunch of fliers that have been posted for the other three bikes that have been stolen.  That was pretty quick.  Also, why did they just take the fliers like that?  Couldn’t they have just told everyone about the fliers?  One of them features a police sketch-esque portrait of Jesse, which doesn’t make any sense because the kid knows that Jesse was with Michelle so he doesn’t need to post fliers about the theft, he can just figure out where Michelle lives.  Also, it&#8217;s hard enough to believe that any fliers were posted so quickly, much less one that features a police sketch.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a ring at the doorbell so everyone hurries to stash the bikes upstairs again and then Jesse opens the door, revealing Leonard, the enormous dad of the kid that Jesse stole the bike from.  Leonard says that he&#8217;s looking for Jesse because he stole his kids bike which reiterates how unnecessary that flier was.</p>

<p>The Crime Stoppers continue to do their best to solve the case in the kitchen, and I can&#8217;t help but notice that setting up your headquarters in someone&#8217;s house without their consent is something of a crime itself.  At least the people in the full house are the ones being imposed upon for once.  Anyway, Stephanie tries to distract the crime stoppers with a really shitty card trick as DJ and Steve lower the bikes out of the window so they can sneak them out of the house.  You know what the best way to get those bikes out of the house without getting caught would be?  Just tell Leonard and the Crime Catchers to get the fuck out.</p>
