<p>Jesse practices his piano playing until his wife and kids come home, at which point he chases the kids around and tickles them for about a full minute.  Although there is some sense of authenticity to these kinds of ordinary, everyday family moments that we&#8217;ve seen on the show more and more often lately, I can&#8217;t help but feel that they don&#8217;t belong on a tv show.  They really do feel like they&#8217;re just there to fill up space.</p>

<p>Michelle walks into her room and asks Stephanie, &#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t we ask DJ before we borrow her stuff?&#8221; which is totally out of character for her.  Since when does she give a shit about asking anybody for anything?  I don&#8217;t care if it&#8217;s obviously for the purpose of exposition, I don&#8217;t buy it at all.  DJ comes in the room and gets hella mad about her stupid ugly sisters taking her shit and then Danny comes in and is all, &#8220;what&#8217;s the big fucking problem this time?&#8221;  They give him the skinny and then he busts out some real democratic dad advice and then leaves.</p>

<p>Becky and Jesse convene at the full house after taking the twins to their separate activities and confirm that their quick-fix solution was completely successful.  Jesse acknowledges that going to a support group for 3 minutes was the right thing to do and then the music comes on as he admits that he didn&#8217;t want to go to the group because he felt like it would expose what a shitty dad he is.  Becky tells him that it&#8217;s important to admit it when problems arise and that if he&#8217;s gone this long without being called out on his cartoonishly inept parenting (not to mention his cartoonishly inept work ethic, musical talents, and ability to pay rent, to name a few) then he&#8217;s probably in the clear.  Then they make out while the audience goes, &#8220;WHOOOOO!&#8221; which is an occurrence that actually bookends this episode.  I wonder if someone actually planned that or if it just happened that way.  I can&#8217;t think of any reason that it would be planned&#8230;  I mean, it was an episode about parenting.  Also, it&#8217;s not like any thought goes into this show at all.</p>
