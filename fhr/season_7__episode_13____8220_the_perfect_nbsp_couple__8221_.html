<p>So, naturally, the game show is about couples and will feature Danny and Vicky as an engaged couple, DJ and Steve as a dating couple, and Jesse and Becky as a married couple, because who wants to watch anything that&#8217;s not all about the people in the full house, right?</p>
<p>Jesse tries to prep Becky for the questions that they&#8217;ll be asked on the game show but she is able to easily prove that she already knows everything about him.  Jesse gets all bent out of shape about her claims that he is predictable but, honestly, what did he expect?  Seriously, the guys has like 4 basic characteristics that totally define him.  This is what happens when a character treads water for 7 Seasons with no development whatsoever.  I could go on this dating show with Jesse and get a perfect score, and so could anyone else who&#8217;s ever seen a single episode of Full House.  I can guarantee you that every question could be answered with either, Elvis, &#8220;Have mercy,&#8221; fried chicken, hair maintenance, neglecting your wife, motorcycles, neglecting your children, doing a half-assed job at work or terrible covers of Beach Boys songs.  There&#8217;s literally nothing else to him.  The only thing I find at all surprising about this scenario is that the show seems to actually be self-aware about this.</p>

<p>Stephanie is left in charge of Michelle and the twins because everyone else is on the stupid dating show.  She is immediately overzealous about being issued a morsel of authority but it&#8217;s quickly taken away from her when she tells the twins to put their pajamas on and they yell some sort of nonsense at her and then run out of the room.</p>
<p>Before the dating show begins filming, everyone reviews the issues that they&#8217;re having:  DJ is convinced that she and Steve don&#8217;t really know each other, Jesse feels like Becky thinks that he&#8217;s too predictable, and it turns out that Vicky isn&#8217;t going to be able to make it on time so she&#8217;s replaced by the producers assistant, Estelle.</p>

<p>Estelle continues to correctly guess the answers to all of the questions about Danny.  She even knows that his recurring nightmare is about being naked on a Stairmaster.  For reals?  Danny naked on a Stairmaster is my recurring nightmare, too.  Becky continues to know everything about Jesse and he gets all up in arms about it, suggesting that the magic is gone because he&#8217;s so predictable, but then he realizes that it&#8217;s good because then she can tend to his every need so they start making out and then leave the set to go fuck.  That&#8217;s really what happens.  It&#8217;s not even subtle.</p>

The show wraps up with Danny and Estelle having the best score and winning a vacation.  Afterwards, the producer commends Joey&#8217;s antagonistic performance but Joey tells him that he couldn&#8217;t do that to people every week and quits, which is the first time he&#8217;s ever shown any integrity.</p>
<p>Vicky arrives at the set and tells Danny that she missed the show because she was getting hired to anchor &#8220;the network news&#8221; in New York.  Danny is unable to be happy for her because it means that they&#8217;ll be even further apart and then the music comes on as he says that them being away from each other all the time is too painful and he can&#8217;t wait anymore for them to start their life together.  Vicky suggests that Danny moves to New York and he says that he can&#8217;t because he has like a whole village worth of people living in his house who are totally unable to take care of themselves.  Things get real serious and dramatic as they realize that love is not enough and they&#8217;re going to have to go their separate ways and then they hug goodbye, drawing the most passionless and unconvincing relationship in television history to a close.</p>

<p>Back at the full house, Danny stares silently into the fire place, probably trying to remember one single potent memory he shared with Vicky and completely drawing a blank.  That would actually be a pretty good Zen exercise.  Try to remember one thing that Vicky ever said or did.  It really clears your mind.  Anyway, the girls all bring Danny a tuna melt and rub him so he&#8217;ll feel better.</p>
