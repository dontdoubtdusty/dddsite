Stephanie accepts his offer because it&#8217;s the only time in her whole life that a boy has ever paid any attention to her on account of her face and fashion sense and general demeanor.</p>

<p>Stephanie runs into DJ&#8217;s room, which has just been rearranged by Danny (which seems pretty invasive.  Seriously, what teenage girl wouldn&#8217;t totally freak out if one of their parents went in their room and moved all their shit around?), to tell her that she has a date.  Kimmie Gibbler is there, too, and she makes some sort of wiseass remark but I was too distracted by the poster behind her, which presents a photo of a whale and the Herman Melville quote, &#8220;We cannot live for ourselves alone&#8221; which is the most deeply ironic thing that anyone in the full house could have posted up in their room.  It&#8217;s amazing to me that the poster didn&#8217;t immediately burst into flame when it was pinned to the wall of a house containing the most self-absorbed pieces of shit on the entire planet.  I wonder if someone on the crew of the show didn&#8217;t put it up as a joke.</p>

<p>As soon as Michelle leaves the room, Gia gets all up in Stephanie&#8217;s face like, &#8220;bitch, you stole my man!  You betta back the fuck up!&#8221; but Stephanie asserts that, no, she will not back the fuck up, which is actually sort of impressive.  Gia&#8217;s like, &#8220;aight, biatch, that&#8217;s yo&#8217; ass&#8221; and then leaves the room while shooting mad eye daggers.</p>

<p>Danny continues to rearrange all of the furniture in the full house, much to everyone&#8217;s dismay, and then Stephanie comes home and tells DJ and Kimmie Gibbler about what happened at school, which prompts her to start plotting revenge.</p>

Your customs are strange and could only be explored by the emotionally unhealthy!  Michelle in particular is perturbed by this event, and I kept waiting for her to utter some sort of anti-Japanese racial slur.  You can&#8217;t tell me that you&#8217;d find that surprising!</p>

<p>Mickey and Stephanie make a giant print-out of Gia&#8217;s abysmal report card and stick it up in the hallway at school.  All the kids point at it and laugh, including the stupid looking kid with the backwards hat, and then, further emphasizing the turning of the tides, Jamie asks Stephanie if they can renew their date.  Gia enters the hallway and sees the sick burn, which is quite cathartic for Stephanie until Gia starts crying.  Whatever, man.  Gia totally started that shit.  Kids like that, who instigate conflict and then can&#8217;t handle it when it goes the other way, are the worst.  You can tell that shit really rubs me the wrong way because I&#8217;m defending Stephanie.</p>
