<p>Becky and Danny have a disagreement about an upcoming feature on Wake Up, San Francisco, which is about the ten millionth time that it&#8217;s been painfully apparent that the show is in desperate need of a producer.  I think it&#8217;s pretty safe to say that most morning show hosts don&#8217;t have to curate their own shows content, plus I can&#8217;t help but remember all the times that Danny was flailing around aimlessly on the air.  Maybe if they just hired one competent person to work things out behind the scenes, Wake Up, San Francisco wouldn&#8217;t be such a train wreck all the damn time.  Anyway, DJ comes downstairs and Danny asks her to settle the dispute in an attempt to fill the void that should be occupied by a competent professional, but DJ reminds him that she doesn&#8217;t have time for everyone&#8217;s self-absorbed nonsense because she has to study for her test.  Just that moment, Stephanie enters the room and tells everyone that she has something really important to share.  After she prevents DJ from leaving to go study, Stephanie divulges that her teacher told her that she has a natural gift for learning languages.  I&#8217;d be pretty pissed off at this point if I was DJ.  She&#8217;s really trying to be clear to everyone that she has something really important that she has to take care of and then her stupid sister is wasting her time by forcing her to hear about some arbitrary compliment her teacher gave her.  It almost seems like studying for the SATs is inadvertently teaching DJ a much deeper, more valuable lesson, which is that her whole family are a bunch of selfish pieces of shit.</p>
<p>The uncles walk into the room and say that dinner is ready but DJ says that she&#8217;s too nervous to eat and then excuses herself to go make some tea.  While she&#8217;s in the other room everyone bands together to further their meddling and Danny declares that they should downplay the importance of the SATs to put DJ&#8217;s mind at ease.</p>

<p>Everyone tries unsuccessfully to convince DJ that the SATs are &#8220;just a test&#8221; and then Steve comes over with some classical music cd&#8217;s to help her study with.  The doorbell rings, which DJ insists on answering for some reason even though she&#8217;s the only person that&#8217;s busy.</p>

<p>The next scene opens with DJ sleeping in her room until Michelle wakes her up by blowing a whistle in her face.  She tells her that it&#8217;s already morning and DJ is startled to discover that she&#8217;s slept in and will be late for her test.</p>
<p>DJ rushes into the SAT room and discovers that it&#8217;s being run by the neighbor that she was shitty to.  The neighbor refuses to inform DJ of the changes that have been made to the test, which were announced before her untimely arrival, and then DJ sits down at her desk and notices that she&#8217;s still wearing her bunny slippers.  She then discovers that she&#8217;s forgotten her calculator but then Joey runs in the room and brings her a gigantic, old-timey adding machine.  It&#8217;s around this point that it becomes obvious that (*SPOILER ALERT*) this is all just a dream sequence.  Joey whips out the Joe Pesci potato from the night before and shows it to the teacher, which doesn&#8217;t make sense because DJ actually wasn&#8217;t in the room when the Joe-Pesci-potato schtick occurred and therefore wouldn&#8217;t have it present in her subconscious mind.</p>
