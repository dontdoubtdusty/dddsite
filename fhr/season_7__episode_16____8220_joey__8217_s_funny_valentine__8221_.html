If it&#8217;s not the backyard then it has to be the Smash Club.  Those are the only choices.</p>
<p>The girls come home after returning Big Sid&#8217;s bird and tell Danny that they&#8217;ve been offered any one item from his store catalog as a reward.  DJ wants a big screen tv but Stephanie argues that they should get a karaoke machine instead.  She explains what a karaoke machine is for the sake of context because I guess it wasn&#8217;t as common a thing in the 90&#8217;s, especially for the shows target audience, since hardly anyone who watched Full House back then were drunken college students.  Anyway, this is like the dumbest fucking argument I&#8217;ve ever heard in my life.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;ve gotten plastered and sang, &#8220;You&#8217;ve Lose That Lovin&#8217; Feelin'&#8221; in front of a bunch of strangers in a bar more than a few times in my life, but what the fuck do you need a karaoke machine in your house for?  And even if you did think that it would be a fun thing to have, there&#8217;s no way that any sane human being would choose it over a big screen tv.  I&#8217;m also surprised at the suggestion of a karaoke machine because of the Tanner family&#8217;s frequent disrespect towards Japanese culture.  It almost seems like it&#8217;s intentionally supposed to be a terrible suggestion, but it&#8217;s never really played that way.  Naturally, Danny gives the deciding vote to Michelle, because she gets to decide everything that ever happens.  Because she&#8217;s the devil.</p>

<p>Later, back at the full house, Joey makes passive-aggressive references to the family having no sense of humor.  Danny, Jesse and Becky all tell Joey that his new girlfriend is a real c-word and then Joey tells them that if they don&#8217;t want to be around her then they can&#8217;t be around him either.  Well, shit, Joey, why don&#8217;t you go and get YOUR OWN FUCKING APARTMENT THEN, FOR GODS SAKE?  WHY DON&#8217;T YOU FUCKING MOVE OUT, YOU WORTHLESS, OBNOXIOUS PIECE OF SHIT?!!?  TAKE YOUR SHITTY SWEATERS AND YOUR TERRIBLE IMPRESSIONS AND YOUR STUPID FUCKING FACE AND GO START YOUR OWN LIFE, FOR FUCKS SAKE.  IT&#8217;S BEEN SEVEN YEARS!  I CAN&#8217;T TAKE THIS ANY MORE.  WHY DOES HE STILL LIVE IN THE FULL HOUSE?  HE&#8217;S NOT HELPING ANYONE!  EVERYONE IN THAT HOUSE IS SO TERRIBLE BUT HE IS THE WORST ONE!  THE ABSOLUTE WORST!  HE&#8217;S FINALLY GIVING THEM AN OUT!  JUST TELL HIM TO LEAVE!  DO IT!  PLEASE, JUST TELL HIM THAT HE HAS TO MOVE OUT!</p>

Or maybe it&#8217;s easy come, easy go.  Or maybe it&#8217;s just another reminder that Michelle is the fascist dictator of a house full of obnoxious whitebread assholes.  Yeah, that sounds about right.</p>
<p>Danny gathers everyone together and tells them that they have to placate Joey&#8217;s stupid girlfriend by laughing at everything she says or Joey will get all butthurt again. Meanwhile, on the front porch, Roxy worries about being re-introduced to the family so Joey tells her not to worry about being funny and to just be open and honest instead.  Sounds like we&#8217;re about to witness a little bit of that classic sitcom miscommunication!  I&#8217;m also totally blown away by there being a set for the front porch all of a sudden!  Why now, after years and years of scenes that nonsensically took place in the backyard?  A front porch set seemed like a simple solution to countless logistical problems dozens of times before but they never used one until now, and all because Joey had to give his lame girlfriend a pep talk so his family would like her even though there&#8217;s no way she&#8217;ll ever be on the show ever again no matter how this turns out.</p>
