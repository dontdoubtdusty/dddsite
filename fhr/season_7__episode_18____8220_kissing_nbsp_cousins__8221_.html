                        <p>Pre-Credits Gag:  Becky finds the twins wearing cowboy outfits and building a fort out of cushions in the living room.  She tells them that they shouldn&#8217;t have used all of the cushions in the house and then it turns out that Joey did it.  How many of the pre-credits gags are about the kids seemingly doing something stupid and then it turning out to have been Joey?  How many of the jokes on the show in general are like that?  Also, Joey does an impression of John Wayne after emerging from the cushion fort that includes these really odd motions with his arm that seems offensive in a way that I have trouble defining.</p>

He even got it in his eye.</p>

<p>This actually isn&#8217;t the first time they&#8217;ve ripped off the old Patty Duke identical Cousin routine on this show.  During the first episode that Papouli appeared in, when Jesse&#8217;s entire Greek family showed up at the full house (except for Stavros for some reason), one of the Olsen twins played Michelle&#8217;s identical cousin.  Although that&#8217;s not very interesting, I just thought I&#8217;d mention it because I&#8217;ve been watching this shit for over 3 years now so I&#8217;m cursed with such trivial knowledge and I literally have nowhere else to apply it.</p>
<p>Stavros manipulates the family into letting him stay at the full house.  The first thing he does is take the girls to the race track.  When he comes back, he leaves Danny&#8217;s car parked in front of a fire hydrant, which doesn&#8217;t make sense for a lot of reasons.  First of all, I&#8217;m pretty sure that being from rural Greece wouldn&#8217;t prevent him from knowing that he shouldn&#8217;t do that.  If he knows how to drive a car then he should know where not to park it.  If he didn&#8217;t know better then why would he bother to mention it to Danny at all?  And why would Danny let him borrow his car if he&#8217;s so unfamiliar with American driving customs?  Finally, why didn&#8217;t he just park in the driveway?  After Danny runs outside to move his car, Stavros hustles Joey at cards, scoring $20 and his watch.  He also orders a pizza that he coerces DJ into paying for, claiming that he doesn&#8217;t have any money.  He says that the pizza is for everyone but then no one wants it because it&#8217;s got lamb guts all over it.  Yeah, I always hate it when someone orders a lamb guts pizza.</p>
<p>Becky comes home from working out and Stavros is compelled by how hot her ass looks in that little unitard.  He starts rubbing his boner all over her in the kitchen and she tells him to back the fuck off because, even though she&#8217;s been systematically destroyed by her shitty husband, she&#8217;s still a strong enough woman to know that even though she looks super fine in her skin-tight gym clothes, that doesn&#8217;t give every oversexed ethnic stereotype the right to harass her.</p>

<p>Everyone tells Jesse about what a rotten son of a bitch Stavros is, which I was actually sort of impressed by because direct communication is so rarely seen as a solution to a problem on this show.  Naturally, this approach completely fails, as Jesse is personally offended by factual accounts of his cousin being a shitty creep.  As Jesse completely disregards the legitimate concerns of all of the people he&#8217;s closest to in defense of some obscure relative of his, Stavros comes downstairs with a packed bag, reporting that he has to go home to Greece to help his village because it was destroyed by a natural disaster.  Everyone is immediately fooled by this obvious ruse and then they all set to work planning a fundraising dance-a-thon at the Smash Club to help out.</p>

<p>Stavros calls an end to the dance-a-thon and accidentally drops a plane ticket as he heads into the crowd to collect money.  Becky and the girls find it and discover that Stavros is leaving for Florida later that evening, which leads them to conclude that the whole dance-a-thon is a scam.  Yeah, I don&#8217;t really know how they got from point A to point B that time, but whatever.  They decide that they&#8217;d better tell Jesse about it rather than just confront the situation themselves for some reason but then they conclude that Jesse still wont believe them so they&#8217;d better cook up a zany scheme to expose Stavros, then they do that fake huddle whispering that I hate so much while Becky explains the plan.</p>

<p>After Jesse&#8217;s condescending, self-aggrandizing speech that&#8217;s tragically devoid of truth and self-awareness, Stavros is ushered away and then Jesse apologizes to the crowd and offers to return their money.  DJ suggests that they give the money to the children&#8217;s hospital instead and everyone applauds.  Um, ok.  I mean, of course it&#8217;s always a good idea to donate money to the children&#8217;s hospital, but that just kind of came out of nowhere.  Jesse apologizes to Becky for not listening to her and she&#8217;s like, whatever, it&#8217;s not like he ever listens to her about anything anyway.  Then she says, &#8220;when you care about someone, sometimes it&#8217;s hard to see the truth&#8221; but is lamentably unable to apply this knowledge to herself.  Poor, tragic Becky.  She would have been better off with Stavros.</p>
