                        <h1>Season 7, Episode 19, &#8220;Love on the&nbsp;Rocks&#8221;</h1>
                        <p><em>Original Date: 2013-06-21</em></p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Pre-Credits Gag:  Michelle plays Simon Says with the twins.  She tells them to sit on the floor and they do it but then she points out that she did not say Simon Says.  One of them says, &#8220;who&#8217;s Simon?&#8221; and then the other one says some total gibberish that I couldn&#8217;t understand at all.  I almost thought that he said, &#8220;It&#8217;s Farsi,&#8221; which is a Persian language.  Anyway, Michelle explains the rules of Simon Says and then Jesse comes in and says to come and eat ice cream in the kitchen.  Michelle runs to go eat it but the twins stay put.  Jesse asks them why they don&#8217;t get up and one of them says, &#8220;can&#8217;t do it&#8221; and the other one says &#8220;issawoose.&#8221;  This is getting really frustrating.</p>
<p>Kimmie Gibbler comes over to the full house with her new boyfriend, Keanu.  When she introduces him to Danny she greets him as &#8220;T-Bag,&#8221; which is one of those cases where I can&#8217;t tell whether the writer is intentionally slipping in a dirty joke or just totally naive.  Steve discuses the movie they all just saw with DJ while Kimmie Gibbler makes out with Keanu and then Kimmie Gibbler comments on how boring and lame Steve and DJ are.  After Kimmie Gibbler takes her boyfriend home for some hot finger-banging, Steve tells DJ that he&#8217;s gonna be out of town next week to go to L.A. with his film class.  She doesn&#8217;t take the news very well because apparently that week is her vacation from school (I don&#8217;t know what vacation that would be but whatever).  He says that he&#8217;ll stay in town if she wants him to but she urges him to go, but then there&#8217;s a close up on her sad face as sad music plays during their hug.</p>

<p>Jesse replies to him by saying, &#8220;no, it&#8217;s not time for breakfast.&#8221;  Oh!  He said, &#8220;time for breakfast&#8221;?  I would have never figured that out in a million years. It&#8217;s weird because these aren&#8217;t the original twins so it&#8217;s not like they just stuck with the first babies they got and are trying to make due with their total inability to speak.  These kids were actually hired to say this stuff.</p>

<p>Kimmie Gibbler and her boyfriend try to get DJ to come with them to some makeout party but DJ says that she&#8217;d feel weird going by herself, what with Steve being out of town and all.  The couple leaves and then everyone in the full house except for Joey surrounds DJ and lays out their revenge plan for Joey&#8217;s prank.  They&#8217;re going to tape the reading of the lotto numbers and buy what would have been a winning ticket, then they&#8217;ll switch the ticket with the one Joey will buy and play the tape when he wants to watch the current broadcast so he&#8217;ll think he won (they&#8217;ve never mentioned before that Joey plays the lottery ever week but whatever).</p>
<p>DJ stays home on Saturday night to watch the twins and wait for Steve to call her.  Steve calls and says that L.A. is super fucking cool and then he has to hang up abruptly because Suzanne Somers wants to use the payphone.</p>

<p>DJ goes mountain climbing with Kimmie Gibbler and her boyfriend.  She gets freaked out by how high up they are and asks them if they&#8217;re scared, too, and Kimmie Gibbler says, &#8220;I&#8217;m too dumb to be scared,&#8221; which struck me as pretty odd.  I guess you can just chalk that up to lazy writing.  I mean, it&#8217;s not an allusion or anything.  Why would anyone ever say something like that about themselves?</p>

<p>DJ comes home and finds Steve waiting for her and he&#8217;s hella mad because he just got back from L.A. and they had a date that she stood him up for.  DJ says that she&#8217;s been doing hella stuff while he&#8217;s been out of town and basically forgot all about him.  Apparently a week has passed between the last scene and this one.  It&#8217;s usually pretty easy to convey a quick passage of time on tv but this one seems really inorganic and abrupt for some reason.  Steve accuses DJ of being negligent to get back at him for going out of town and then she straight up kicks him out of the full house.</p>

If they really were able to anticipate this ping-ponging of pranks then you&#8217;d think that they&#8217;d have come up with something a little more clever for the final outcome.  I mean, a bucket of water?  They might as well have just kicked him in the nuts.</p>
