                        <p>Well, here we go.  Season 7.  Before I get started, I want to give a shout-out to FHR supporter Hebrewersfan for purchasing the Season 7 DVD&#8217;s back when I said I wouldn&#8217;t keep writing this blog unless somebody purchased them for me.  Hebrewersfan, what happens next is all your fault.</p>
<p>Ok, for reals now.  Season 7, here we go:</p>
<p>Pre-Credits Gag:  The twins refuse to sleep in their new racecar beds, insisting on sleeping with their parents instead.</p>

<p>Stephanie says that she&#8217;s had a hard time saying goodbye to all of her friends at camp, too, and then she starts counting all the friendship bracelets she&#8217;s gotten from boys, which are the middle school equivalent of notches on your belt.  Damn, y&#8217;all, Stephanie handled more dicks than Samantha on Bewitched!</p>

They tell all of the kids to go to bed so they can go party with the other counselors, which will probably involve some serious consumption of pixie sticks.  Steve enters the cabin next, because he is of course a counselor, too, but he covers his eyes at the door to prevent the possibility of accidentally seeing a bare breast because he wants the first time it happens to be special.</p>

<p>In the morning, Jesse bitches to Joey about how the twins wont sleep in their new beds and are keeping him up.  Although I find Joey&#8217;s unsightly mullet pretty distracting, I couldn&#8217;t help but notice that the kids&#8217; drawings that are posted on the cabinets behind him have been updated, which is probably the most astute attention to detail that there&#8217;s ever been on this show.  It&#8217;s like somebody actually gave a shit!  They must have gotten a new set decorator who isn&#8217;t jaded yet.</p>

<p>Stephanie excuses herself to go write letters to all the dudes she banged over the Summer,  DJ follows her because she wants to call Steve, and Michelle trails behind them for no real reason other than that the premise of this episode is that the dads are all butt hurt about how the girls totally like going to camp more than living in the full house and didn&#8217;t miss their corny dads at all.</p>
<p>As the girls unpack upstairs, Michelle reveals that she brought that rabbit from camp home instead of freeing it into the wild like she was supposed to.  Danny enters the room to gather the girls&#8217; laundry and is less than thrilled to discover the rabbit.  Steve shows up moments later and gives DJ a sexually repressed hello hug before Danny addresses the fact that the rabbit can&#8217;t live in the full house because it&#8217;s a wild animal, plus they already have a dog and like 50 fucking people living in that goddamn house. He tells Michelle that the rabbit needs to live in the woods with its friends but Michelle replies that she is the rabbit&#8217;s friend, which makes the audience go, &#8220;aww.&#8221;</p>

<p>Steve enters the cabin and tells everyone that his car&#8217;s stuck in a big mud puddle.  Rather than addressing the fact that they&#8217;re stuck at the camp unless he finds a way to get his car out of the mud, Michelle just worries about whether or not Cropsy is going to come in and murder them.  Oh, if only!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back at the full house, Jesse and Becky join their kids in their racecar beds in attempt to get them to finally sleep there.  The kids still don&#8217;t like the beds for whatever reason but their parents are so exhausted that they fall asleep in the tiny plastic racecar frames.  The twins sneak away from their sleeping parents to go sleep in their bed while this really weird music that&#8217;s never been featured on the show before plays.  It sounds like something from an old Disney cartoon or something.  The twins say goodnight to each other and then they hug, and that is the end of the twins-wont-sleep-in-their-racecar-beds storyline.</p>

<p>Back at the full house, the family all make s&#8217;mores in the fireplace and leave a plate of them on the couch while they wait for them to cool down.  Naturally, Joey comes into the room and sits on them and then he runs around screaming about his burning anus.  This is one of those checkpoints in this series, where a moment is so stand-out terrible that you can&#8217;t help but acknowledge that, even though it&#8217;s always been awful, it has now reached a new level.  As the family all stand around guffawing while Jesse sprays whipped cream all over Joey&#8217;s ass, it&#8217;s impossible not to recognize that the stakes have been raised.</p>
