                        <p>Hey, guys!  Super rad cartoonist <a href="http://www.carolynmain.com/">Carolyn Main</a> made this FHR tribute painting and <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Full-House-Painting-original-by-artist-/281128193553?">she&#8217;s selling it on ebay!</a>  I thought it was a beautiful enough work of art to post here, plus she said she&#8217;d buy me a sandwich if it made her some money.  She&#8217;s also helping me find someone to improve the ads on this site.  These reviews are going to be all done in about 6 months and I&#8217;d like to try to monetize the massive amount of traffic I get between now and then.  If any web savvy folks can help with this, drop me a line at billysuperstar@gmail.com.  It&#8217;s preferable that you live in the Portland, OR area because that&#8217;s where Carolyn lives and she&#8217;s the one who you&#8217;ll be working with.</p>

<p>DJ comes home and Danny tells her that Steve called.  She gets all nervous and wants to know what he wanted because it&#8217;s the first time he&#8217;s called since they broke up but Danny says he didn&#8217;t ask because who gives a shit?  They were boring when they were together and they&#8217;re even more boring now.</p>
<p>As Michelle and Becky work on their plans for the downhill racer in the living room, Jesse and Danny come in and start making a bunch of misogynistic jokes.  Becky plays along because her dignity and self-respect has been effectively nullified after years of being married to Jesse.  Although it&#8217;s pretty obvious that they&#8217;re being facetious from the tone of voice they&#8217;re all using, a bunch of shots of Michelle&#8217;s stupid face reveal that she&#8217;s deeply affected by the exchange that&#8217;s happening before her.</p>

<p>Becky follows Michelle into the full house and tries to convince her to continue sitting there and not helping while she does all the work.  Stephanie and DJ chime in to support Becky&#8217;s cause but Michelle is still like, &#8220;fuck it.&#8221;  As Becky heads out to the backyard to optimistically continue to build the racer (because it&#8217;s not like she&#8217;s busy with a full-time job and two kids of her own or anything so she&#8217;s got all the time in the world to help out some shitty ungrateful little girl) she finds Steve at the back door.  He stands there awkwardly for a minute until DJ finally tells him to come in, like he&#8217;s a vampire or something.  It&#8217;s really an odd moment.</p>
<p>DJ and Steve have a stilted exchange until she starts blurting out a bunch of stuff about how she knows that it&#8217;s hard to get over her but he&#8217;s just going to have to learn to move on with his life.  Steve appears confused and then clarifies that he just came over to ask for his Sting CD back.  They have a brief and remarkably uninteresting discussion about how they&#8217;re feeling after their break-up and then they agree that they can still hang out even though they&#8217;re no longer a couple.  They leave the full house together to go have pizza and no sex, just like old times and, incidentally, Steve never gets gets his Sting CD back.</p>
<p>Oh, shit, you guys, this next part&#8217;s pretty rough.  Joey practices ballet in the basement with Stephanie while wearing tights that totally show off his nut sack.  It&#8217;s really bad.</p>

I usually don&#8217;t bother to mention it because there&#8217;s not much to do beyond quote it and say that it sucks, and there are about ten examples of it in every episode, but I thought that this one was particularly uncreative.</p>
<p>As Joey continues to practice his ballet he says that while he practices he pictures himself as a squirrel gathering nuts.  I guess that the topic of intolerable wordplay was apropos here because Joey just had to mention nuts while wearing those awful tights.  Well, that settles it.  I&#8217;m officially celibate.  Anyway, Jesse and Danny eventually jump out and mock Joey for doing ballet and for the first time in Joey&#8217;s life he is self-conscious enough to experience shame.</p>
<p>After humiliating their idiot friend, Jesse and Danny head upstairs where they find Michelle sitting in her room, which they take as a sign that something is wrong for some reason.  Michele says that she quit the downhill derby because Becky was helping her and girls can&#8217;t build cars.  Danny asks her where the fuck she came up with that bullshit and she tells him that Kenny told her.  Danny says that Kenny&#8217;s a fucking asshole who doesn&#8217;t know shit about dick but then Michelle recounts all of the misogynistic jokes that everyone was telling the other night and how deeply they affected her.  Danny says that it&#8217;s totally mind-blowing that Michelle is unable to detect sarcasm after living in a sitcom her entire life but it&#8217;s really not that surprising since girls are so dumb, but then Jesse says that girls can do anything that boys can do, which comforts Michelle.  Joey comes in the room and Danny apologizes to him for gender-stereotyping by mocking his ballet and then Michelle decides that she&#8217;s going to continue to not really help Becky build that car after all so she can enter the downhill derby race.</p>
<p>Michelle goes to the backyard and has basically the exact same conversation with Becky that she just had with all the dads, except this time the music comes on.  Becky apologizes for making facetious jokes about gender stereotypes and then she tells Michelle that being a girl is pretty special and the good stuff about it is still coming up.  I assume that she&#8217;s referring to yeast infections and unfair wages.</p>
