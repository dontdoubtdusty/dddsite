                        <p>Before I get started, I just had the point out that the title of this episode is a euphemism for masturbation.  It may as well be called, &#8220;Go Jerk Off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stephanie pesters Danny to extend her curfew and he tells her that she&#8217;d better watch her step because they wouldn&#8217;t even have to write her off the show to get rid of her.  She hasn&#8217;t been cute for like 5 years and there&#8217;s not a person in America who would give a shit if she got Judy Winslowed.  Denise comes in through the back door and I guess she just had a growth spurt because she&#8217;s seriously like a foot taller than Michelle.</p>

<p>Michelle&#8217;s teacher tells the kids to greet Danny and they all say, &#8220;hi, Michelle&#8217;s dad,&#8221; and he responds with, &#8220;hi, Michelle&#8217;s class,&#8221; which is an acknowledgement of the fact that everyone in the full house universe exists only to orbit around Michelle.  I wouldn&#8217;t even be surprised if all of the characters started being referred to exclusively by their relationship to her.  Danny would be &#8220;Michelle&#8217;s dad,&#8221; Jesse would be &#8220;Michelle&#8217;s Uncle,&#8221; DJ &#8220;Michelle&#8217;s oldest sister,&#8221; Stephanie &#8220;Michelle&#8217;s stupid ugly sister&#8221; and Joey would be &#8220;the guy that will never move out of Michelle&#8217;s house for no clear reason.&#8221;  Anyway, enough about that because, all of a sudden, Teddy&#8217;s back!</p>

<p>Michelle&#8217;s teacher tells all the kids in Michelle&#8217;s class to shut the fuck up and listen to Danny because he&#8217;s going to introduce a class project.  Danny tells them that they&#8217;re going to do a life-sized tracing of their best friend and then he shows them one he did of Joey, which I don&#8217;t even need to make fun of because look at it.</p>

<p>Jesse invites Roxy to be a guest on the show and then she and Joey start riffing with each other on the air, which makes Jesse feel left out.</p>

<p>Oh, so anyway, Michelle tells them that she likes them both and asks how she&#8217;s supposed to decide between them.  She does this while her arms are extended with the palms facing up so they know that she is being sincere.  Both kids start bribing her with trinkets and candy and stuff but then when she starts comparing their bribes they get all pissed at her and tell her to go fuck herself.  As much as I hate to take Michelle&#8217;s side, it&#8217;s weird to me that they get so bent out of shape about the whole bribery thing when it was totally their idea.  Anyway, Teddy and Denise leave to go be best friends without Michelle and they abandon her to sit by herself as sad music plays and then the dog starts licking her face, which is a really bizarre act break if you ask me.  I&#8217;ve gotten really used to the hyper-manipulative extended shots of characters sad faces with dramatic music playing for the act breaks, but having the dog lick one of those sad faces is just utterly strange if you ask me.  It&#8217;s actually kind of a refreshing change of pace.</p>

<p>Jesse, Joey and Roxy come home and Stephanie compliments Joey and Roxy&#8217;s repartee on the show, then she says that Jesse should have been there, implying that she didn&#8217;t notice that he was.  Joey and Roxy apologize to Jesse for dominating the show but Jesse tells them that he doesn&#8217;t mind and that the bottom line is that it made for good radio, which is the first mature response he&#8217;s ever had in any situation.  Joey takes his positive response as a go-ahead to invite Roxy back on the show the next day, which Jesse agrees to even though he&#8217;s is clearly bothered by it (which immediately nullifies his supposedly mature response).</p>
<p>Jesse is left alone in the kitchen and then Michelle comes in and asks him what to do when your friends exclude you.  Jesse points out how convenient it is that their two storylines have such obvious parallels and then he tells her to make new friends, which is blatantly terrible advice.  Becky comes in and Jesse convinces her to do a guest spot on his radio show so he wont feel left out by Joey and Roxy.  Becky agrees since she doesn&#8217;t mind being used like this because she&#8217;s just totally given up on everything.</p>
<p>Steve returns the last of his stuff to DJ and they both seem pretty chipper about it.  Man, their amicable breakup is just as boring as their sexless relationship was.  Michelle comes in and asks DJ if she can trace her for her stupid project because she&#8217;s her best sister.  DJ is touched but then Michelle clarifies that she&#8217;s only asking her as a last resort because Stephanie said no.  DJ then refuses because Michelle is a raging asshole who can&#8217;t even feign tact out of desperation.</p>

<p>Danny comes back to Michelle&#8217;s class to see how the projects came out, which seems awfully convenient (it was supposed to be parent volunteer day, not parent volunteer several days), and then Teddy and Denise present their posters of each other and talk about how great one another are, which makes Michelle sad.</p>
