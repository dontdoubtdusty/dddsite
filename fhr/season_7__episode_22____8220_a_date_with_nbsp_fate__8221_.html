<p>Becky has a moment alone with Danny and touches upon the fact that he&#8217;s been totally sad and pathetic since he and Vicky broke up and the only cure for his melancholy would be some hot fucking.  She mentions a camerawoman who works at the station who totally wants to bang him and urges Danny to call her up and hit that shit.  Danny ignores the tried and true saying that you should never dip your pen in the company ink and focuses instead on the fact that she&#8217;s only 25, which might actually be an even bigger problem considering that Danny&#8217;s in his mid-30&#8217;s.  Becky&#8217;s like, seriously, Danny, you&#8217;re a fucking sad sack, just call her up, and then he gives in and agrees.  Leave it to middle-aged men to always heed the beck and call of too-young poontang.</p>
<p>Jesse tries to teach the twins to sing a song for Becky on Mother&#8217;s day, with the &#8220;help&#8221; of Joey, who sings the twins&#8217; part while doing that little baby voice that I hate so much.  All the twins have to do is say, &#8220;today is Mother&#8217;s Day&#8221; when Jesse points at them but they&#8217;re completely incapable of doing it.  At least in this case their inability to deliver lines on cue is incorporated into the storyline.  Very metatextual.  Jesse lays out this big plan he has to make Mother&#8217;s Day special for Becky, which has to be the most effort he&#8217;s ever put into anything in his whole marriage, if not his entire life, but then the twins threaten to fuck it up by refusing to sing one very simple line of a song.</p>

<p>DJ&#8217;s date, Roger, shows up and he&#8217;s like 45 years old.  Danny does a little bit of a screening interview and asks him how old he is and Roger says that he&#8217;s 20, which is just preposterous.  I guess that this is around the time that 90210 was on the air so middle-aged actors playing characters half their age was in vogue.</p>

<p>Danny comes in with his date, Leona, and immediately goes to say hi to DJ.  She asks why they&#8217;re there instead of the French restaurant they were planning on going to and Danny explains that it both prevents them from having to build a second set and furthers the plot if they all end up in the same place.  Actually, I&#8217;m amazed that they didn&#8217;t all just go to the Smash Club.  Anyway, Leona is intrigued by Roger&#8217;s mustache so they all decide to sit together.</p>

<p>DJ and Danny sit together and lament their lameness after being ditched.  Just then, Steve shows up with his date and they all have a brief chat that clarifies that Steve&#8217;s date is an idiot and he&#8217;s not really into her, then they walk off.  I&#8217;m not really sure what the point of that was&#8230;  It would make sense for there to be a moment in the story where DJ feels upset that Steve is dating because her date sucked, but it&#8217;s immediately nullified by Steve&#8217;s date also being crappy.  It&#8217;s a moment that sort of cancels itself out.  I guess they&#8217;re just trying to cook up excuses to have Steve show up on screen from time to time because he was contracted for a full Season.</p>

After DJ and Arthur leave, Danny sits there feeling sorry for himself until an older woman complains about how dirty her table is, which triggers his obsessive compulsive cleaning habit. After he wipes her table off, she tells him to sit with her and asks why he&#8217;s feeling so sorry for himself.  He says that he just got ditched after being on a date where he thought that he was guaranteed to get his dick wet and then the woman&#8217;s hot daughter shows up, recognizes Danny from his terrible morning show, and says that she&#8217;s always wanted to bang him.</p>

<p>Joey is carrying a tray of donuts that&#8217;s supposed to represent the breakfast that they were going to make in the morning.  Jesse starts to get all bent out of shape about the impromptu rendition of his Mother&#8217;s Day plan and tries to put a stop to it but then the twins start pulling out the gifts that they made.  Jesse grows increasingly perturbed as the one time that he&#8217;s made any effort to be a good husband or father is ruined for him and then the twins mutter some gibberish that apparently insists that they sing the Mother&#8217;s Day song now.  They start chanting that they want to sing it now and Joey chimes in, which makes me hate him more than ever.  Why is he so dedicated towards encouraging the twins to fuck up Jesse&#8217;s plan?  I know that this is saying a lot but I think that this is the most annoying thing he&#8217;s ever done.</p>
