                        <p>Pre-Credits Gag:  Joey tries to show the twins how to use safety scissors and they&#8217;re immediately more capable of using them than he is.  Is it me or has Joey gotten extra worthless lately?  I mean, he&#8217;s always been cartoonishly incompetent, but in recent episodes he&#8217;s been shown as being intellectually on par with the twins, who can&#8217;t even form complete sentences, and now they seem to be surpassing him.  If I wasn&#8217;t harboring such deep hatred for him I&#8217;d be experiencing pity.</p>

<p>Michelle goes upstairs to sulk and Joey starts ranting about how much dick it sucks that her art class was discontinued so Danny convinces him to come to that evening&#8217;s PTA meeting.</p>

<p>At the PTA meeting, Joey and Danny are greeted by Marcia Wallace, who makes a return appearance as the neighbor who always sexually harasses Joey.  Apparently she&#8217;s also the head of the PTA, a position that&#8217;s up for reelection but has no other candidates.  The PTA has nothing else to discuss besides baked goods so Danny mentions that it fucking sucks dick that his ugly daughter&#8217;s art class lost its funding but then Marcia Wallace explains that school budgets are not a matter for the PTA, which is a surprisingly clear and adult explanation.  As a matter of fact, I think that&#8217;s the first valid and accurate point in the entire series.</p>
<p>Danny reacts to this valid and accurate point the only way he knows how: by completely ignoring it.  He stammers through a bunch of gripes about how shitty it is that there&#8217;s no art class and then Joey gets up and starts making his own case for art classes.  As if it weren&#8217;t disturbing enough that Joey&#8217;s actually trying to make a worthwhile contribution to society, Marcia Wallace is totally staring at his ass the whole time.</p>

<p>So, anyway, Joey does his best rendition of an impassioned speech about the importance of art, which of course ends with a terrible impression of Daffy Duck and him spitting all over some poor parent&#8217;s head.  Everyone applauds Joey&#8217;s shitty speech because everyone in the full house is always rewarded for bothering a bunch of unsuspecting strangers every time they go out into the world, then Danny suggests that Joey runs for PTA president and everyone else agrees that it&#8217;s a good idea.</p>
<p>Jesse looks around for his Little Richard tickets before discovering that the twins have cut them up and made them into a collage.  Again, I can&#8217;t help but point out that even the most moderate amount of supervision could have easily prevented this from happening.</p>
<p>Joey comes home and laments the fact that Marcia Wallace has been campaigning for PTA president all over the place.  Michelle comes in with Denise and Derek and they&#8217;re all totally covered in pro-Marcia Wallace propaganda that she gave them after bribing them with frozen yogurt.</p>

<p>Anyway, Little Richard bestows his flamboyance unto the children for a minute and then Michelle asks him to play &#8220;The Itsy, Bitsy Spider&#8221; for her, which he immediately agrees to.  He tells her that he needs a piano and she leads him down into the recording studio even though there&#8217;s a piano right behind him, next to the front door.</p>
<p>Little Richard walks into the kitchen just as Danny utters his oft-mentioned phrase to Joey, &#8220;I&#8217;ll toss the salad.&#8221;  You know, I&#8217;ve always heard that if you go into the bathroom, turn off the lights and repeat that phrase three times, Little Richard will appear.</p>

<p>30 minutes after Little Richard was supposed to show up at the benefit, which, surprise, surprise, takes place at the Smash Club, there is still no sign of him.  Danny tries to stall the crowb by stammering like an idiot into the microphone and then Marcia Wallace usurps the stage.  Why is she even allowed to be there?  She claims that a man who can&#8217;t provide the entertainment he promised for some stupid event doesn&#8217;t have what it takes to be PTA president, which is a pretty far-reaching claim, and also the least of so many reasons why Joey isn&#8217;t qualified to be in charge of anything. Danny tries to further stall by calling Jesse and Joey up to the stage and getting them to sing some song with him that I didn&#8217;t recognize at all.</p>

<p>So, wait&#8230; the problem about the arts funding is never resolved?  That&#8217;s weird.  Not only is it left hanging, but Marcia Wallace&#8217;s initial point about the PTA having no control over school funding is no less accurate by the end, so this was really all for nothing.  If they really cared about arts funding so much then why didn&#8217;t they have Little Richard perform at some sort of benefit for the arts instead of a campaign party for Joey?  The craziest thing about all of this is that Michelle didn&#8217;t end up getting what she wanted.  I mean, things seem to be moving in that direction, but we&#8217;ll never see it come to fruition.  Even though it&#8217;s just the result of careless storytelling, I find it to be pretty unsettling that the one thing we&#8217;ve come to rely on from this show was never realized.</p>
<p>Firsts: a valid and accurate point is made, Michelle doesn&#8217;t get everything she wants</p>
