<p>DJ complains to Joey that he&#8217;s been in the bathroom for almost an hour and then AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Stephanie walks into her room while Michelle&#8217;s practicing the harmonica and asks her to practice in the basement recording studio, which, to be fair, is specifically designed for just that sort of activity.  Michelle tells Stephanie to go eat a dick because she can do whatever she wants all the time because she is the queen of the universe.</p>
<p>DJ complains to Danny about Joey hogging the bathroom but Danny assures her that Joey will come out eventually because he&#8217;ll need to eat.  Suddenly, as if on cue, a pizza man comes out of the bathroom, which prompts the audience to hoot and applaud as if they&#8217;ve actually seen something clever.  Just as Danny joins DJ&#8217;s bid to get Joey to come out of the bathroom, Stephanie runs out into the hallway after having snatched Michelle&#8217;s harmonica and Michelle straight up bum rushes her.  It&#8217;s a surprisingly violent moment.</p>

Just then, Jesse barges into the bathroom to sneak a peak at Joey&#8217;s sad little manhood and to complain to Danny about the stuff that he was mad about during the pre-credits gag.  Jesse&#8217;s whole platform is that Danny never checks in with him before doing things in his own house that he owns and that he should really make more of an effort to consult with all of the lazy freeloaders that he supports before making decisions that homeowners are entitled to.  Before Danny can tell him to go find his own place to live, for fucks sake, the doorbell rings.</p>
<p>Danny goes downstairs to answer the door as his three horrible daughters, plus Jesse, all bitch and moan at him and then he opens the door, only to discover that there&#8217;s nobody there.  He tells everyone to back up off his nuts and that they&#8217;ll have a house meeting that evening so they can complain in a more structured manner.</p>
<p>After Danny is left alone in the living room, a strange man emerges from the back hallway and makes a remark about how much the house has changed.</p>

<p>Lou Bond is a rad character because he gives Danny a stern glare every time he makes a shitty joke.  I guess that he&#8217;s got some actual standards for humor since he used to be on a way better sitcom.</p>

<p>Everyone expresses great joy over this progressive prospect and for a second it seems like this horrible nightmare could finally come to an end, but then sad music plays as the camera slowly pans over to Michelle, who looks sad.  Oh, god damn it.  I think we all know where this is headed&#8230;</p>

<p>They go up to DJ&#8217;s room and Michelle has totally rearranged everything to look slanted so that Lou Bond will think that the foundation is fucked up.  What a lot of effort that must have taken!  Seriously, that&#8217;s a pretty impressive feat.  I wonder how pissed DJ will be that her sister totally fucked up her room like that?</p>

<p>The rest of the family come home to find a pack of dogs running through the kitchen and into the backyard.  Danny enters the room with Lou Bond and asks Michelle what her muthafuckin problem is.  He asks her why she had to cook up a zany scheme to fuck up the inspection instead of just telling him that she didn&#8217;t want to move and she says that nobody gave a shit about how they weren&#8217;t going to all be living together anymore, which makes the audience go &#8220;aww&#8221; but doesn&#8217;t really answer Danny&#8217;s question.</p>
<p>Michelle drops some more sentimental bullshit about how important the full house is to her and then Lou Bond blows her off and whips out his checkbook.  The music comes on and Danny says that he and his shitty family can&#8217;t ever move out of the full house because it&#8217;s an evil entity that has consumed them and wont ever let them leave, and so they must spend eternity trapped within its walls, where they will forever invade one anothers personal space and have endless trivial conflicts that can only be resolved when the house emits soothing music that inspires platitudes and cornball sentiment.  Everyone else is equally persuaded by the music and recounts their own fond memories of living in the full house and then, after Jesse and Becky agree to remain cramped in the attic even though they can totally afford their own house, they straight up thank Michelle for manipulating them into staying.</p>
<p>Danny tells Lou Bond to go fuck himself because they&#8217;re not selling the house.  After he leaves, Denise brings Comet in from the backyard and tells him, &#8220;Comet, you live here.&#8221;  The dog walks over to Michelle and then there&#8217;s a dramatic pause before she says, &#8220;we all live here,&#8221; which is supposed to be an introspective moment but really just comes off as an incredibly redundant statement.  No shit you all live there, asshole.</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s one more Season all wrapped up.  Tune in next week for Season 7 reviewed, as well as a bunch of announcements about plans leading up to this blog&#8217;s ending and what&#8217;s to come after it&#8217;s finally over.</p>
