                        <p>Have you ever seen The Apartment, with Jack Lemmon and Shirley Maclaine?  It&#8217;s a really great movie.  But we&#8217;re not here to talk about that.  We&#8217;re here to talk about a really shitty episode of Full House that has the same name.</p>
<p>Pre-Credits Gag:  Jesse pretends to be sick so his kids can play doctor, then he gives them horsey rides.</p>

<p>After this strange bomb is so casually dropped, DJ mentions that she and Kimmie Gibbler are going over to Steve&#8217;s new apartment after school.  How the fuck can Steve afford an apartment in San Francisco?  I can&#8217;t afford an apartment there, and I&#8217;m a grown ass man with a pretty decent job.  I guess we can assume that his parents are rich, seeing as how we&#8217;ve never seen them or even heard one thing about them so we can pretty much draw whatever conclusions we want without any threat of being contradicted.  Anyway, Danny is uncomfortable about DJ going over to Steve&#8217;s, probably because she told him about it 2 seconds after telling him about her pregnant teenage friend.  Both of these pieces of information really seem like they would have come up earlier, by the way.  Seriously, DJ never once mentioned to her family that Steve was getting his own apartment until after he moved in?</p>

<p>Michelle comes home and says that she&#8217;s having a terrible day because next Monday is hobby day and she doesn&#8217;t have one to speak of.  What a conundrum!  See, that&#8217;s the bad example Joey sets in action is what that is.  Michelle&#8217;s life is equally devoid of pressure and responsibility and yet she just can&#8217;t handle it.  This moment also brings us another example of how Michelle extends her arms out with her palms up to convey sincere emotion.  I guess her acting coach must have taught her that one between Seasons.  Anyway, this whole premise is nonsense because we all know that her hobby is being a condescending asshole, and she&#8217;s really, really dedicated to it.</p>
<p>Jesse lists some of his own hobbies and mentions that he&#8217;ll be cementing the driveway over the upcoming weekend.  Becky suggests that he hire someone else to do it because he&#8217;s a completely incompetent piece of shit but he insists that they&#8217;ll save a bunch of money this way.  Yeah, we all know that this is gonna work out fine. Just to eliminate any chance that it might not be a disaster, he enlists Joeys help.</p>

<p>Steve demonstrates the benefits of having his own apartment, like playing music really loud and eating ice cream out of the container.  Naturally, it&#8217;s vanilla.  DJ mentions that Kimmie Gibbler couldn&#8217;t make it over there and learns that Steve&#8217;s roommate is at the library, so they find themselves alone together for probably the first time ever, what with all the legions of people who have no regard for privacy that live in DJ&#8217;s house.  They start making out and then DJ leans over and turns the light off, heavily implying that she is ready to fuck.  I guess she understood what that vanilla ice cream was alluding to.</p>

<p>Steve reacts in a way that is contrary to the behavior of every teenage boy in history: he&#8217;s totally cool with it.  He shoulda tried that line about how when you get a hard-on for a real long time it makes your balls hurt real bad and he&#8217;s just trying to relieve the pressure.  It&#8217;s a crucial step in the hand job coercion.  Instead they just decide to watch The terminator.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back at the full house, Jesse and Joey try to calculate how much money they&#8217;ll save by cementing the driveway themselves while Joey still wears that stupid fucking beret!  I feel like he&#8217;s doing it just to aggravate me!  Anyway, Danny comes downstairs and says that he&#8217;s worried about DJ because it&#8217;s after midnight and she still isn&#8217;t home.  Why are the uncles sitting around in the living room doing calculations after midnight?  I kind of always assumed that everyone in the full house would be in bed by like 8:30.  Danny doesn&#8217;t have Steve&#8217;s phone number so he calls up Kimmie Gibbler, who has a rad fish pillow and a shoe phone in her room, which we see for the first time.  Kimmie Gibbler scolds Danny for letting DJ go to her boyfriend&#8217;s house unsupervised in the first place and calls him T-bag, which is a reference to a favorite activity of his.  Eventually she tells him that Steve&#8217;s phone isn&#8217;t hooked up yet but gives up his address. Why didn&#8217;t Danny get any of this information beforehand?  Even a dad that wasn&#8217;t all paranoid would want to know that stuff.</p>

<p>Adding to all of this nonsense, Becky gleefully points out to the uncles that they worked backwards when they cemented the driveway and now the cement mixer is stuck in the backyard until the cement dries.  She seems really amused by their failure for some reason.  Jesse decides that he has to run the cement mixer to keep the cement from hardening and Joey rubs his temples and quotes his tranquility tape.</p>

<p>DJ and Steve sit inside the cab of the cement mixer so they can be alone.  Sure, why not?  They kvetch about what a hard time everyone is giving them and then DJ tells Steve that it&#8217;s &#8220;sexy&#8221; that his nostrils flair up when he&#8217;s angry.  Ew, gross!  This leads to them making out, which they never really did before this episode, by the way, and then DJ steps on some sort of lever or something that makes the mixer lower it&#8217;s cement pouring thing (yeah, sorry, I don&#8217;t know the terms here), which crashes through the window and starts pouring cement into the kitchen.  Joey is sitting right in front of the window while this is happening but he allegedly can&#8217;t hear it because he&#8217;s listening to one of his tranquility tapes, but it&#8217;s not like he ever does anything to help anyway and is probably just choosing to ignore it.</p>

<p>The next scene is of Danny and DJ reconciling in her room.  Wait, what?  Didn&#8217;t he find her and Steve gettin&#8217; busy in the truck, which was the cause of all of that destruction?  It seems like that would actually validate all of Danny&#8217;s concerns.  Seriously, that cement pouring into the kitchen is like a metaphor for the destructive nature of DJ and Steve&#8217;s sexual urges (the cement represents Steve&#8217;s sperm).  But, anyway, it&#8217;s not like any of this shit makes sense anyway, but we&#8217;re 22 minutes in so it&#8217;s time for the music to come on and for everyone to feel better.  Danny apologizes for not respecting DJ&#8217;s privacy and then he says that things are getting more complicated as she gets older and he wishes her mom wasn&#8217;t dead so she could help him deal with it.  Wait, but what about Vicky?  She&#8217;s supposed to be the replacement mom now, right?  Maybe she really is gone forever without any explanation.  Anyway, DJ reassures Danny that she&#8217;s totally lame and will never give it up, then they hug.</p>

Man, I hope they don&#8217;t start doing these regularly.  Anyway, Jesse and the twins chisel Joey&#8217;s feet from a block of cement while he&#8217;s still wearing that stupid fucking beret.  Great, they just had to make us look at it one last time.</p>
