                        <p>Pre-Credits Gag:  The Uncles sing, &#8220;Louie, Louie&#8221; with the twins.  I&#8217;m pretty sure that there was a pre-credits gag almost exactly like this with Michelle in one of the first Seasons.  Butchering classic songs is a rich tradition on this show.  I still say that the twins aren&#8217;t nearly as bad as Michelle, though.</p>

<p>Stephanie walks through the door with a handheld video camera and tells everyone that she&#8217;s making a video about her family for school.  I guess it isn&#8217;t really that important but I think that this premise could have used some additional context.  Is the school just really fascinated by her family, or is this for a specific class, or what?  What educational purpose could filming her family all the time serve?  Is it a sociology experiment about what happens when you cram a bunch of pushy, corny white people into one big house?  All we know is that it&#8217;s &#8220;for school.&#8221;  Anyway, she starts filming Joey and makes some shitty comments about how gross his nose hairs look and then he tells her &#8220;you can&#8217;t use that&#8221; in reference to the footage she just took.</p>
<p>DJ and Steve hobble down the stairs because her chain got caught on his sweater and they need help getting unstuck because it&#8217;s really difficult to resolve a problem like that.  People this stupid should not be allowed to have chains and/or sweaters.</p>

<p>Becky hangs out in the kitchen with the twins while they bang on tupperware, which prompts her to start singing the theme song from COPS into a turkey baster for kind of a long time.  Stephanie comes into the kitchen with Jesse and films the whole thing, but when Becky finds out she tells Stephanie, &#8220;you can&#8217;t use that.&#8221;  Jesse tries to goad Becky into letting Stephanie use the footage by chucking her chin and telling her to &#8220;be a good sport&#8221; and it seems pretty heavily implied that he&#8217;s going to punch her in the face if she doesn&#8217;t do what he says.</p>

<p>Michelle&#8217;s soccer team meet on the field for some rare outdoor scenes.  I&#8217;m kind of surprised that all of the soccer games don&#8217;t just take place in the back yard.  Joey tries to help Derek not totally suck ass at being the goalie and then Danny strolls onto the field to see how things are going.  Michelle takes her turn at trying to kick the ball into the big netted goal post thing and she&#8217;s as bad at playing soccer as I am at writing about it.  On her second try she makes her shoe fly off, which is cause for concern for Danny.</p>

<p>Eventually they get to the footage of Michelle fucking up at the soccer game, at which point she hangs her head as the audience goes, &#8220;aww.&#8221;  A few seconds later she bounces back by making light of the situation, showing us all that she&#8217;s learned a valuable lesson about laughing at your own mistakes, and that poorly-written wise-cracks are the panacea to every problematic circumstance.</p>
<p>Michelle meets her crew of neglected youths on the soccer field and Aaron Bailey immediately starts talking shit to her.  The dads all start ganging up up him in Michelle&#8217;s defense, which seems a little unfair to me.  Jesse suggests that there&#8217;s a height requirement for being obnoxious, which is easily unproven by everything that any of the kids has ever said or done throughout the entire series.  Why, Michelle was obnoxious when she was still in diapers!  Anyway, Michelle says that she doesn&#8217;t give two shits about Aaron Bailey&#8217;s worthless opinions and then she starts running the wrong way after prompting everyone to head onto the soccer field.  They all yell after her but then she turns around like, &#8220;I was just fuckin&#8217; with y&#8217;all.&#8221;</p>
