                        <p>Pre-Credits Gag:  Michelle tries to impress Stephanie with her sock-puppet ventriloquism skills but then it turns out that she&#8217;s just cheating by having Joey do the puppet&#8217;s voice from the closet.</p>

I like how casual they&#8217;ve become about her ruling all of their lives.  Vicky offers to make dinner for everyone at the full house since she&#8217;s gonna get married to Danny and will have to get used to making everyone dinner anyway.  Take that, women&#8217;s lib!  Danny says that he&#8217;s not sure if that&#8217;s such a good idea since the girls are such finicky eaters and then before Vicky can point out that there&#8217;s never been any mention of the girls selective diet before and that it just sounds like a cheap plot device, the twins come back and squirt Danny in the face.</p>

<p>The twins search for Jesse during a rousing game of hide and seek and they find him behind the love seat in DJ&#8217;s stylish bedroom.  He tells them that it&#8217;s now their turn to hide and they just stand there looking confused for a long time while he attempts to shoo them off.  I&#8217;m guessing that these scenes with the twins are mostly improvised because they&#8217;re usually pretty ambling and I&#8217;m willing to bet that those kids aren&#8217;t exactly prodigious when it comes to taking stage directions.  As a matter of fact, they clearly have no idea what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>While hiding from Jesse in Michelle&#8217;s room, the twins totally fuck up her solar system diorama.  She comes in and freaks out and calls all the adults into the room.  She asks Danny why the twins are such assholes and why they didn&#8217;t listen to her when she told them to stop fucking up her diorama and he passive-aggressively tells her that they&#8217;ve never been taught how to listen by their parents while Jesse and Becky are standing there.</p>

She&#8217;s hesitant to accept their apology but then Danny gives her a pep talk about the importance of graciously accepting apologies before shooing her out of the room.  Once she&#8217;s gone, Danny tells Jesse and Becky that their kids are out of control.  How come nobody ever mentions that the diorama wouldn&#8217;t have gotten fucked up if they didn&#8217;t let the kids run around the house unsupervised all the time?  Why isn&#8217;t supervising your children ever a value that&#8217;s learned in the full house?  This has been a problem since the beginning!  Anyway, Jesse and Becky admit that their kids are assholes and agree to start setting some limits, but for some reason they never point out to Danny that he needs to start doing this, too, because this is a problem that has plagued the full house for many a year.  Seriously, the irony in this scenario is excruciating.</p>

<p>The kids all agree that the food Vicky made was actually pretty good and then Michelle says that she would be saying that she liked it even if Danny hadn&#8217;t paid her.  Vicky&#8217;s like, &#8220;what the fuck?&#8221; but then she forgives Danny immediately, rendering an already pointless storyline even more so.</p>
<p>Jesse comes back downstairs as Vicky serves up vanilla ice cream for everyone, noting that there are 2 extra bowls because they were meant for Nicky and Alex.  Well, she already knew that they weren&#8217;t getting dessert, and it&#8217;s not like any preparation really went into it, so what the fuck?  Jesse places the bowls on the counter and then begins to hallucinate his kids faces inside of them calling him, &#8220;mean daddy,&#8221; so he decides to sneak them upstairs.</p>

<p>Anyway, the music comes on as Becky tells Jesse that being a dad means being a disciplinarian sometimes and maybe his own dad wasn&#8217;t so bad.  Then they excuse the twins from their time out, followed by hugs.</p>
