                        <p>Pre-Credits Gag:  Michelle gives the dog a cookie for rolling over on command, and then the twins roll over on the floor so they each get a cookie, too.  Then the twins and the dog all roll around on the floor because they want more cookies.  This pre-credits gag seems like a pretty shameless effort to cram all the pets and littlest kids onto the screen at once.  At least the dog is pretty cute.</p>

Everyone acts like she&#8217;s going to murder them if they don&#8217;t do what she says.  I think that this would be a way better show if a gigantic convict played the role of Michelle.  It would definitely make more sense of the way that everyone treats her.</p>

<p>Stephanie washes her hands after taking a big disgusting shit in the bathroom at the Junior High.  She discovers that the hand dryer is broken so she drags an excessive amount of toilet paper out from the stall and over to the sink for some reason.  I guess this is supposed to be some form of physical comedy but it doesn&#8217;t even make any sense.</p>

<p>The first trick of Junior High that Mickey shows Stephanie is that the hand dryer actually does work, you just have to twist it like a combination lock before you push it, which makes about as much sense as what Stephanie did with the toilet paper.  Why is everything that happens in this bathroom so unorthodox?  Maybe the writer was raised in a shack in the woods or something and has no relationship with our newfangled water closet devices.</p>

<p>Joey and Jesse argue about the name of the show.  Joey wants to call it &#8220;Teen Talk&#8221; and Jesse wants to go with &#8220;Yakkin&#8217; with Youth.&#8221;  Those are both pretty bad, but, I&#8217;m loathe to admit, Joey&#8217;s is clearly the better title.</p>
<p>A troubled youth calls in to ask for advice about homework but all the uncles can do is argue some more about the stupid name of their worthless fucking show.  They go out into the hallway to argue while DJ fields the question which is, thankfully for her, within her severely limited realm of experience.  After DJ dishes out some advice, she and the other teens just sit there not knowing what to do because the uncles are still arguing in the hallway.  Dead air ensues.  How can these guys have an advice show when they&#8217;re so clearly unable to manage their own lives?</p>

<p>Later, back at the Junior High bathroom, Mickey and Stephanie rebelliously apply make-up until a group of girls come in who seem awfully unruly, as indicated by one of them finishing an anecdote upon entering the room with, &#8220;so I said, &#8216;that&#8217;s the worst fake I.D. I ever saw.'&#8221;  That&#8217;s some truly inspired dialogue is what that is.  You really know everything you need to know about these characters from that one line, and not just because they&#8217;re all tragically one-dimensional.</p>

<p>Stephanie comes home and plays cards with Michelle and Aaron Bailey in her room but she gets all pissed off about their improvised rules so she has a big hissy fit and then goes downstairs to color with the twins.  While the babies are coloring she starts to pretend that a white crayon is a cigarette and then her mimed smoking provokes one of the twins to say, &#8220;bah stuffy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, down at the radio station, the uncles continue to argue over the name of their show while DJ, Steve and Kimmie Gibbler just sit there.  Wait, is this supposed to be the next day?  It would have to be to correlate with the other storyline, plus the kids are wearing different outfits.  Does that mean that these kids are regulars on this show?  It would also mean that the uncles have now spent two entire episodes arguing over the name of the show and not giving out any advice.  You know, these two fucks have been sucking so bad at every job they&#8217;ve had for seven years now. I just don&#8217;t know what else is left to say about it.  Anyway, they all decide to vote on what the title of the show should be and then DJ ends up being the deciding vote and she says the only sensible thing that anyone&#8217;s ever said on this entire series, which is that both titles are lame.</p>
<p>Their discussion is cut short by a caller, which makes me wonder what was supposed to be happening on the air while this discussion was happening if they&#8217;re still taking calls.  The caller is a foreigner named Olga who turns out to be Stephanie doing a really bad accent, which makes sense because who the fuck else would be listening to this show?</p>

<p>Stephanie paces back and forth in her room until Danny comes in and tells her that he was able to deduce that she was Olga.  Stephanie apologizes for not telling him what happened, although you can&#8217;t really blame her for worrying that it would get her into trouble because we all remember that very special episode from one of the early Seasons when DJ got in hella trouble for knowing some kids who drank beer.  Anyway, Danny tells Stephanie that he&#8217;s proud of her for not smoking and then she tells him that she thinks that she still wants to be friends with Mickey even though she is troubled.  The music comes on as Danny tells her that she should be friends with Mickey if she wants to but if she doesn&#8217;t then she shouldn&#8217;t feel like she has to, which is the most ambivalent advice that has ever accompanied the music.  Stephanie asks Danny some more questions about how she should approach Mickey that sound remarkably like questions about dating and Danny still doesn&#8217;t really provide any real answers.  He just says that it gets easier.  Man, that was the most ineffective music ever.</p>
