<p>Michelle cleans her room and then the twins run in and yell, &#8220;pushell.&#8221;  She tells them that she can&#8217;t hang out because she has to clean her room and then they start putting her toys into her foot locker, which is apparently the sole requirement of cleaning her room, so Michelle just lays back on her bed and watches them do her work for her.</p>

Well, no shit.  He couldn&#8217;t even put in the effort to pick the garbage up off the floor so it&#8217;s not like he could be expected to read a book or something.  Jesse is denied the loan and I guess that we&#8217;re supposed to feel bad for him about how the club that he was given for free can&#8217;t be opened because a bank wont give him some money to fix it up because he didn&#8217;t even try a little bit to figure out what he needed the money for.  Why doesn&#8217;t he just hit his wife up for the money?  Or Danny?</p>

<p>Michelle sits in the backyard and makes the twins do her bidding.  It&#8217;s actually a really short scene, probably due to the extremely limited capabilities of all of the actors involved.</p>

<p>The lady from the bank shows up and starts going over details with Jesse.  She says that the food preparation area will have to be upgraded and then Jesse paces around and stammers while trying to remember the number of that code even though she never asked him what it was.  Michelle comes in from the kitchen, where all the girls are listening in, and comes up with a lame excuse to show Jesse her hidden piece of paper that has the code written on it.</p>

<p>After Jesse stammers and cheats his way through the interview for several more painful minutes, the lady from the bank asks him why he wants to reopen the Smash Club.  He tries to get his nieces to sneak him the answer even though it&#8217;s an open-ended question and then he makes a half-assed attempt to deliver a business-centric answer and then the lady from the bank tells him that she can&#8217;t help him.  Out of desperation, Jesse says that he&#8217;s not a businessman and doesn&#8217;t belong in her suit-and-tie world, and then the music comes on as he explains that he wants to reopen the Smash Club because he loves it and he wants there to be a corny, g-rated nightclub for freakishly wholesome people who enjoy terrible covers of songs that weren&#8217;t that good in the first place.  Then he tells her that he&#8217;s going to find a way to reopen the club with or without a loan from the bank (presumably by &#8220;borrowing&#8221; the money from his wife, or Danny) and she replies by telling him that she&#8217;s going to approve his loan.  She explains that he provided exactly the right answer because it came from his heart, which is the biggest load of bullshit I&#8217;ve ever heard in my life.  How many entrepreneurs have been told to stick their dreams up their asses even though they were a million times more qualified and prepared than Jesse is here?  All those unfortunate, cast-out individuals had plenty of heart, too.  Jesse getting this loan for no reason is one of those cases where this show surpasses naivete and just ends up being straight-up insulting.</p>
<p>Finally, for no reason at all, the lady from the bank tells Jesse that she&#8217;s seen him perform at the Smash Club a bunch of times because she used to be a cage dancer there.  What?!!?</p>
