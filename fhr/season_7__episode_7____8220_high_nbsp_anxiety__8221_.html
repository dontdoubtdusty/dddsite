                        <p>Pre-Credits Gag:  Michelle&#8217;s two front teeth fell out.  Eww, gross!  Since Michelle is played by twins and the odds of them both losing their front teeth at the same time are pretty slim, I&#8217;d bet that the one who didn&#8217;t lose them naturally had to have them knocked out by the producers.</p>

<p>After Steve and Kimmie Gibbler snake the last of the bacon in the full house, leaving Danny to wonder why he even lets them in his house that is already overrun with people, Jesse comes downstairs and starts bitching and moaning about how he has to pick a paint color for the club that he had willed to him for no good reason.  Wow, continuity!  It seems like Jesse&#8217;s reopening of the Smash Club is actually going to be an ongoing storyline.  Everyone stresses the importance of choosing the right colors for the club, which makes Jesse nervous.</p>
<p>As the girls prepare to leave for school, Danny gives them each money for lunch, except for Michelle, who has to bring her lunch in a lunchbox like a stupid baby.  She asks why she can&#8217;t buy her lunch, too, and Danny gives her some patronizing answer about how she&#8217;ll lose it.  Adding insult to injury, Danny puts Michelle&#8217;s humiliating hat back on her head as he ushers her off to school.</p>

<p>As Michelle plays frisbee on the school playground with Denise and Derek, Derek throws it over on to the top of the backstop.  A backstop is that tall fenced dome thing that you bat inside of when you play baseball.  I know that because I just spent like 5 minutes googling it to figure out what it was called so I didn&#8217;t have to call it a &#8220;fenced dome thing&#8221; a bunch of times.  Yeah, sorry, I don&#8217;t know shit about dick about sports.</p>

<p>Jesse comes home and asks for advice about what kinds of cups to use at the Smash Club and then DJ comes into the room and says that a delivery guy just dropped off more samples in the living room.  What she neglects to mention is that the samples are toilets.</p>

<p>As Danny goes into Michelle&#8217;s room to say goodnight to her, the tension in the air is palpable.  He admits that he&#8217;s been having a hard time adjusting to her growing up and is going to start treating her more like a big girl.  The music comes on as he says that he&#8217;s going to try to respect that she&#8217;s embarrassed when he kisses her and then there&#8217;s this incredibly awkward moment of tension as he says goodnight to her, starts to lean over to kiss her, and then stops himself.</p>
