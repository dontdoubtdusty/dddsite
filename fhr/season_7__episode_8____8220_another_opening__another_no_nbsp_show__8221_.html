                        <h1>Season 7, Episode 8, &#8220;Another Opening, Another No&nbsp;Show&#8221;</h1>
                        <p><em>Original Date: 2013-04-05</em></p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Pre-Credits Gag:  The twins crawl all over Jesse while he tries to finish up the accounting for his new club.  As he plugs in the last of the numbers, he discovers that they&#8217;re wildly inaccurate and then, instead of just assuming he fucked up the numbers just like he fucks up everything else, he looks inside the calculator and discovers that the twins have filled it with Play-Doh.  I don&#8217;t know why that would cause miscalculations rather than just totally prevent the calculator from working at all.  Seriously, that makes zero sense. It just doesn&#8217;t add up.  Oh!  See what I did there?  No, but really though, that&#8217;s fucking bullshit.</p>

<p>Jesse unveils to his family the garish monstrosity that is the new Smash Club.  It&#8217;s even got a disco ball, just to make it extra tacky and awful.</p>

No wonder this whole opening is such an unmitigated disaster.  Jesse can&#8217;t even do one job well, and now he&#8217;s trying to do the work of like 20 people.  Anyway, Becky starts to tell DJ to set all the tables and then they realize that Kimmie Gibbler is also missing. If only they went into the storage room to get the stuff to set the tables, all of these problems would be solved so quickly.  Instead they get sidetracked by a large group of Steve&#8217;s college buddies filling up the club while chanting &#8220;R.E.M!&#8221;</p>
<p>Kimmie Gibbler calls being stuck in the storage room with Jesse a &#8220;crazy twist of fate&#8221; and he interprets it as her making a pass at him but then she&#8217;s like, &#8220;get real, sucka, I wouldn&#8217;t fuck you with Joey&#8217;s dick.&#8221;  Awkward!  Jesse continues to complain about how badly everything&#8217;s going and what a shitty job everyone&#8217;s doing and Kimmie Gibbler points out that he&#8217;s the one that&#8217;s fucking everything up, plus he&#8217;s being a real dick while he does it.</p>
<p>Joey tries to warm up the crowd with stand-up and then when nobody laughs he walks to the side of the stage and asks Steve what the problem is, which is something that lots of stand-up comedians do when their set isn&#8217;t going well, I&#8217;m sure. Steve explains that all of his friends are foreign exchange students who don&#8217;t speak english, as if we needed an explanation as to why nobody was laughing at Joey&#8217;s jokes.</p>
<p>DJ runs around and tells all the customers that the coffee they&#8217;ve ordered is on it&#8217;s way and then she&#8217;s accosted by Ben Stein, who&#8217;s playing a food critic named Elliot who writes a column called, &#8220;Eating Out with Elliot&#8221; for the local newspaper  I seem to remember a column in Hustler with that same name, and it sure wasn&#8217;t about food.  Also, check out Ben Stein&#8217;s amazing ponytail wig.</p>

<p>Everyone considers closing the club because everything is going so poorly but then Becky gives an inspiring speech about her high school volleyball coach and the resulting upswing in morale inexplicably causes the coffee machine to start working.</p>
<p>Kimmie Gibbler tells Jesse that it really hurt her feelings when he said that her outfit looked like the inside of a dogs asshole and then the audience goes &#8220;aww.&#8221;  The music comes on as Jesse realizes that he&#8217;s been being a real prick and that nobody had a good time as a result.  So I guess the lesson isn&#8217;t about being prepared or working hard or doing your job well, it&#8217;s just about being nice to people, even if they&#8217;re doing a really shitty job.  If that&#8217;s not the lesson, I don&#8217;t know what is.  I&#8217;m really grabbing at straws here.  But what&#8217;s important is that the music is on, so whatever the problem was, it&#8217;s fixed now.  Jesse finds an air conditioning vent in the ceiling and decides to climb up into it.  Maybe that&#8217;s the message that the music brought us:  &#8220;If you&#8217;re ever trapped in a storage closet, climb through the air conditioning vent.&#8221;  Aww.</p>
