<p>Joey had plans to see The Phantom of the Opera with Danny and Jesse and their ladyfriends but his date cancelled (they didn&#8217;t even bother introducing us to this love interest before never mentioning her again) so he gives his tickets to DJ and Steve.  DJ decides that she wants to get her hair did before the show so Jesse recommends his hairstylist, Alejandro.  DJ ends up going to Kimmie Gibbler&#8217;s hairstylist instead and comes home looking all fucked up.</p>

<p>Stephanie and Michelle complain to Joey about how crappy the Action Rigby is and he says that everyone gets ripped off sometimes, then he shows them a ventriloquist dummy he sent away for when he was a kid that didn&#8217;t even have a moving mouth.  If it&#8217;s so shitty then why does he still have it?  Just in case some ugly kids asked him about it 30 years later?</p>

<p>The doorbell rings and, since this show&#8217;s never willing to let anyone learn a lesson without being copiously rewarded afterwards, it&#8217;s Rigby the Rhino, making a personal appearance at the full house.  Everyone treats Rigby like he&#8217;s a real asshole but then he gives the girls each a plush Rigby doll and tells them that every single kid who ordered an Action Rigby will also receive one.  Apparently Rigby was so affected by Michelle&#8217;s protest that he was able to swiftly manufacture these plush dolls and decided to lose millions of dollars by sending them out to all the kids who bought his crappy action figure.</p>
