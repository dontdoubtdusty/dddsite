<p>Kimmie Gibbler comes over and doesn&#8217;t waste any time before mocking Joey and Danny for not having anything to do on Saturday night.  Before heading upstairs, she delivers some expository dialogue to Stephanie about how she and DJ are going to a frat party that evening.  Joey and Danny reminisce about how they used to lie to girls at their frat parties to get them to hold hands with them and wear their promise rings and stuff and then Danny decides he&#8217;d better warn DJ before she finds herself in a similar scenario with some guy who has actual sexual ambitions.</p>
<p>Up in DJ&#8217;s room, Kimmie Gibbler gets all nervous before the party but DJ tells her to chill the fuck out.  Danny comes in and warns them not to believe any frat boys&#8217; horseshit stories and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;sure, whatever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Michelle plays Hungry, Hungry Hippos with Joey, which is the most well-loved game of all time that&#8217;s not really that fun and doesn&#8217;t even work very well.  I hope that whoever named it made a million dollars because if it wasn&#8217;t so fun to say, the game probably would have been a huge failure.  Michelle destroys Joey at it because, on top of being a horrible comedian and human being, he also sucks at Hungry, Hungry Hippos.  The twins come downstairs and want to play with Michelle and she&#8217;s like, &#8220;fuck, I am so sick of those assholes&#8221; but they get all up in her grill anyway.</p>

<p>Kimmie Gibbler gets up and starts being an angry drunk and DJ explains that she already got them kicked out of the party and needs to stop being such an asshole.  Kimmie Gibbler tries to storm out of the house but she passes out before she can because drinking alcohol is really bad, kids.</p>
<p>In the morning, Michelle walks into DJ&#8217;s room and starts asking the sleeping form under the covers what to do about the twins still being mad at her because what the fuck does she care if someone else is sleeping when she&#8217;s got trivial problems that need to be addressed?  It turns out that the sleeping figure is Kimmie Gibbler, who&#8217;s all hung over.  DJ comes in and Michelle demands that she be notified in the future when Kimmie Gibbler sleeps over and then leaves.  DJ reminds Kimmie Gibbler that she was up all night puking and then asks her if she remembers anything that happened the night before.  Kimmie Gibbler gets all agitated and starts recounting that she was the life of the party before DJ ruined everything for her.  DJ&#8217;s like, &#8220;uh-uh, biznatch, I had to cover for you and hold your hair back when you were puking and sleep in a chair while you were passed out in my bed.&#8221;  DJ and Kimmie Gibbler used to have way more irrational fights like this back in the earlier Seasons and I&#8217;ve really missed them.</p>
<p>Kimmie Gibbler brings on a flashback to her version of how things went at the party, starting with DJ hanging out with a couple of stereotypical late-80&#8217;s nerds (they&#8217;re not even stereotypical early-90&#8217;s nerds).</p>

<p>Becky comes in with the twins and tells Jesse that she thinks that they should solve their conflict with Michelle without any adult intervention but Jesse&#8217;s like, &#8220;I never listened to you before and I&#8217;m not about to start now.  Go sit down.&#8221;  And she does.</p>
<p>Jesse begins to deliver an oration on forgiveness to the twins.  He asks them if they can say &#8220;forgiveness&#8221; and one of them says &#8220;porgibinah.&#8221; Yeah, I guess that was a pretty loaded question.  He summons Joey over to him for a demonstration and then he sticks a flounder tart in his shirt pocket and smashes it, spraying disgusting fish liquid everywhere, so Joey can display forgiveness in front of the twins.</p>

<p>DJ heads over to Kimmie Gibbler&#8217;s but finds her nursing her hangover in the backyard, probably because there aren&#8217;t any sets for Kimmie Gibbler&#8217;s house.  DJ begins to tell Kimmie Gibbler her own version of what happened the night before, triggering another flashback.</p>

<p>Kimmie Gibbler is unpersuaded by DJ&#8217;s recounting of events and tells her to kiss her ass and stop trying to run her life.  DJ starts crying and says that her mom was killed by a drunk driver and that she wasn&#8217;t going to let her dumb ass best friend die the same way.  The music comes on as Kimmie Gibbler apologizes and says that it had already been revealed that her mom had been killed in a car accident before but it had never been specified that a drunk driver was involved and that she was just drinking to feel cool and confident.  DJ tells her that she wasn&#8217;t being cool and that she made an asshole of herself but also that everyone gets nervous and you just have to deal with it and stay in control of yourself and then they hug and the audience goes &#8220;aww.&#8221;</p>
