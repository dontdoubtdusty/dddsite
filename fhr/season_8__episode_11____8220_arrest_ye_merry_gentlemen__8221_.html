<p>This episode was actually instrumental in the formation of this blog.  One Christmas, just a few months before FHR started, I was blessed with the holiday miracle of both BET and Nick at Night running hella Christmas episodes of Family Matters over the course of several days during my winter downtime and I couldn&#8217;t get enough of that shit (except for maybe the one where Carl and Urkel get stuck on a train on Christmas.  That one kind of sucked), especially how they kept alternating which family member got to sing a soulful Christmas ballad at the end of the episode.  It&#8217;s like everyone wanted to try to score an album deal so bad that they had to take turns.  Anyway, I was so into Family Matters Christmas episodes that I even settled for watching a Full House one (being another TGIF show, it was close enough) when this very episode came on.  I only caught the last half of it and assumed that it would make more sense when I saw the whole thing, which I was totally wrong about (more on that later).  Anyway, the point is that, even though the experience reminded me that Full House is a way shittier show that brings none of the so-bad-it&#8217;s-good joy that Family Matters does, it&#8217;s probably why I ended up picking Full House after deciding to write a Family Matters review blog and then learning that the series wasn&#8217;t available on DVD.  Up to that point it had been a pretty long time since I&#8217;d watched Full House so happening upon this episode had a lot to do with putting it back on my radar.  You might even say it was a Christmas miracle.</p>
<p>I know that I usually just get right to the review but I just had to regale y&#8217;all with that little anecdote first.</p>

<p>Danny and Becky soak in the Christmas cheer around the full house until Jesse storms in and starts yelling at Joey for making him go to the dry cleaners with him so they could pick up his Santa suit.  Jesse rants for a while about how crowded and stressful shopping is right before Christmas, which is actually a pretty relatable complaint.  Just as Michelle comes downstairs, Becky pulls out the same novelty tie that Michelle bought for Danny, explaining that she&#8217;s bought it for Joey as a gag gift.  Everyone takes a minute to talk about what a gaudy piece of shit the tie is as Michelle comes to realize that it&#8217;s a crappy present.  It&#8217;s always interesting to me how necessary it if for the characters to express their opinions about things like this in order for the audience to understand how we&#8217;re supposed to relate to it.  Like, if they all thought that the novelty tie was amazing I wouldn&#8217;t even question it because these assholes have the worst taste in everything all the time anyway, so it really helps when they spell out their opinions for us.</p>

When he shows it to her she tells him that he was sold parsley and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;well, it&#8217;s not like I ever did anything right before this.  What&#8217;d you expect?  Also, fuck Christmas.&#8221;</p>

<p>DJ, Stephanie and Joey all groan excessively as they try to fit Joey into his Santa Suit.  They come to realize that the dry cleaner gave him someone else&#8217;s suit, which is much smaller, but they are all dedicated towards squeezing him into it so he can perform as Santa for the twins.  As they continue to moan and groan melodramatically while trying to stuff him into the suit, the twins, who are wandering around the full house unsupervised, stumble onto the scene and decide that Santa must be hurting their cousins (and/or sexually abusing them).  Declaring that Santa is a monster, they flee in terror.</p>

<p>Mickey Rooney continues to collaborate with Michelle on practical jokes that they subject Jesse to until Jesse finally gets fed up and declares that he&#8217;s gonna bust out of the novelty store, which is pretty understandable, really.  I mean, seriously, how long can Mickey Rooney hold them there?  And he really does seem to be doing it strictly for his own amusement.  Verifying that theory, Mickey Rooney tells Jesse that he called the cops 20 minutes earlier and told them not to come (how nobody heard this phone call is a question that will never be addressed) and agrees to let them go.  Jesse gets all up in arms and rounds up Michelle so they can get the fuck out of there but then she theorizes that Mickey Rooney was just holding them there so he wouldn&#8217;t be alone on Christmas Eve.  Rather than recognizing that as sociopathic behavior, Michelle decides that it&#8217;s a good reason to invite him to the full house for Christmas. Hey, sure, why not?  Being such a pushy asshole that makes jokes at the expense of others, he does come off as something of a kindred spirit.</p>
<p>Being the gruff, guarded character that he is, Mickey Rooney tells them to get the fuck up out his store, but when Jesse suggests that Mickey Rooney should spend the evening with his own family, he replies, &#8220;which family are you talking about?  The one that doesn&#8217;t write me, or the one that never phones me?&#8221;  Wait, so he has two families?  Anyway, this heavy-handed, self-pitying line from a guy who just held our protagonists captive for hours for no good reason causes the audience to go, &#8220;aww,&#8221; so gentle music comes on and they are prompted to continue to investigate the situation.  Mickey Rooney says fuck his family because they all moved up to Oregon and didn&#8217;t invite him to go with them.  Jesse says that he should swallow his pride and get back in touch with his family because family is the most important thing on account of they&#8217;ll let you live in their attic and don&#8217;t make you pay rent or have a real job and they even make up for your complete inability to raise your own children.  Mickey Rooney tells him to fuck off and get out of his store but as Jesse turns to go, Michelle asks Jesse if they can invite Mickey Rooney to the full house for Christmas dinner.  Mickey Rooney&#8217;s like, &#8220;what the fuck would I want to do some shit like that for?&#8221; but Jesse calls him out on being a lonely old weirdo who has nowhere better to be.  They beg him to come to the full house and he eventually agrees, but first he says he has to run off camera to do something that he&#8217;s been waiting to do for a long time.  Jesse and Michelle have no problem waiting since it&#8217;s not like they&#8217;ve been trapped in that store against their will for a bunch of hours or anything. While they wait, the music comes on again as Jesse says that he had lost his Christmas spirit before, and that the problem with Christmas wasn&#8217;t the stress and rampant consumerism but only his inability to deal with it.</p>
