                        <p>If this episode doesn&#8217;t end up being about DJ getting an abortion I&#8217;m gonna be pretty disappointed.</p>

<p>As DJ and Stephanie get ready to go to the street fair, they&#8217;re greeted by Nelson and Kimmie Gibbler, who refers to Stephanie as, &#8220;El Blondo,&#8221; which gets a big laugh even though it doesn&#8217;t even mean anything.  Is it supposed to be an insult?  Maybe it&#8217;s insulting to people that speak Spanish because their language is being so poorly emulated, but I don&#8217;t know why that would bother Stephanie.  Stephanie asks Nelson what the fuck&#8217;s wrong with him that he&#8217;s decided to start dating Kimmie Gibbler but he&#8217;s like, &#8220;hell naw, I wouldn&#8217;t fuck Kimmie Gibbler with your penis,&#8221; then he starts asking DJ about her relationship with Viper.  She says that Viper&#8217;s pretty rad and then changes the subject to Kimmie Gibbler&#8217;s successful stint as a pie-eating champion.  On that note, Kimmie Gibbler opens up the fridge and just happens to find a cheesecake inside, which she promptly shoves her face into.  You know, I have nothing left to say about the pushy and presumptuous behavior that takes place inside the full house.  There are no more adjectives or synonyms.  It&#8217;s all that ever happens on this show.  It&#8217;s like if I pointed it out when they breathed air.  I&#8217;m done.</p>

<p>Becky and Danny take Michelle and the twins to the park and discover that it&#8217;s been vandalized.  I don&#8217;t know, you guys, that pretty much just looks like your standard San Francisco public park to me.  Michelle, having never been exposed to any harsh realities of life, is taken aback and tells Danny that she wants to go home.</p>

<p>After bringing everyone home from the street fair, Nelson starts macking on DJ super hard and then they share a steamy closed mouth kiss.</p>
<p>He asks her out on a date on Saturday and she agrees.  In the very next scene, DJ and Stephanie exchange some expository dialogue that informs us that DJ and Nelson have now gone out on several dates and things are going well.  DJ tries to convince herself that she doesn&#8217;t just like Nelson for his money but rather because he&#8217;s sensitive and a good listener or some shit like that.  There&#8217;s a knock at the door and DJ opens it, expecting Nelson, but Viper rushes in instead.  He tells DJ that he was a dumb ass stupid idiot to break up with her and he wants her back hella bad.  Just then Nelson walks in and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;what the fuck?&#8221;</p>

<p>After their date, Nelson walks DJ home and comments on how distracted she was the whole time they were out.  She says that she&#8217;s confused because she really cared about Viper and Nelson takes it as yet another opportunity to display what a sensitive and caring fellow he is by telling her that he understands.</p>
<p>The second that DJ walks through the door, Viper pops out and starts serenading her with some crappy apology song that he wrote.  That&#8217;s just what Jesse always does for Becky whenever he acts like a total asshole.  Or at least he would until they got married, then he stopped trying.  Anyway, DJ is totally won over by Viper&#8217;s shitty song so they start smooching.  Nelson walks in to give DJ her big ass bouquet of flowers that she forgot and catches them and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;damn, y&#8217;all, I know that being sensitive and understanding is like my thing and everything, but this is pretty fucked up.  I seriously just left like 30 seconds ago.&#8221;  For reals, I&#8217;m not a guy that&#8217;s cool with slut shaming at all, but I do have to point out that DJ closed mouth kissing two different guys within five minutes is pretty shocking.  For her, I mean.  Not for, like, anyone else.  But for her that&#8217;s straight up promiscuous.</p>

<p>After an odd, forced gag where the teeter totter gets stuck and Kimmie Gibbler is launched into a tree, Viper shows up and starts grabbing on DJ and demanding that she make her choice.  About 2 seconds later, Nelson shows up, making similar demands.  Flustered, DJ tells them that she&#8217;s been agonizing over this decision but, &#8220;it&#8217;s not like picking out a pair of shoes.  I want to make the right choice.&#8221;  Wait&#8230;but&#8230; don&#8217;t you want to make the right choice when you pick out a pair of shoes?</p>
<p>Nelson says that it&#8217;s ok that she hasn&#8217;t made her choice yet and then he asks her if she&#8217;s heard of the Four Seasons.  She doesn&#8217;t really know what he means but then he cues Frankie Valli to come out and lip-synch serenade DJ, which is a pretty grand effort, especially considering that he wasn&#8217;t even sure if she was a fan of his.</p>

Suddenly, they notice that Joey isn&#8217;t there and wonder where he is even though him not being around is probably the main reason they had such a great day.  Jesse says that they had a little spat earlier and then I was really hoping that they&#8217;d cut to Joey&#8217;s dismembered corpse but instead we just see that Jesse staple-gunned him to the fence in the park.  It doesn&#8217;t even look like he&#8217;s hurt.</p>
