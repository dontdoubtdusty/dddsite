<p>Danny takes Michelle to Take Your Daughter to Work Day.  As a kid, I always felt cheated that girls got to miss school on those days and I didn&#8217;t, but I guess that since every other aspect of society is unfairly balanced in my favor, I can&#8217;t really complain.  As Wake Up, San Francisco wraps up, Danny cracks some lame ass joke that makes some crew member laugh until he starts choking.  Michelle hits him on the back, which makes him cough up his food, and it&#8217;s really weird to think about how he might have died if she hadn&#8217;t been standing there.  It&#8217;s almost as weird as the idea that anyone thinks that Danny is funny.</p>

<p>Back at the full house, DJ and Stephanie keep tabs on each other as their no sweets bet continues.  Jesse comes home and says that the twins flipped their shit at the grocery store because they wanted some cookies and then he tries to act like he held his ground but then there&#8217;s this really clever and surprising reveal where the twins walk in and they are eating cookies.</p>

<p>Michelle comes home with Danny and Becky and announces to the family that Becky has been hired as the new producer of Wake Up, San Francisco.  Becky cordially says that she doesn&#8217;t know why she got the job instead of Danny, which is really nice of her, especially considering that it&#8217;s a total lie.  Even though she&#8217;s slowly become a crazier and shittier person since moving into the full house, she&#8217;s clearly much more capable then Danny, especially considering that we&#8217;ve never seen a single instance of him not being completely terrible at his job.  Everyone congratulates her and then Jesse announces that he&#8217;s going to take everyone out for dinner to celebrate.  He doesn&#8217;t mention that Becky is going to have to pay for the dinner, but I guess that&#8217;s kind of a given.  Kimmie Gibbler walks in all of a sudden and hears the big news, which launches her into about a solid minute of cutting into Danny about how much it must suck for him that Becky got hired and he didn&#8217;t.  He says that he&#8217;s totally fine with it but then he walks into the living room and admits to an empty room that he feels sorry for himself, which makes the audience go, &#8220;aww.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joey suggests that they just ask Danny to come back to the show and Becky explains that he&#8217;s the one who quit so it&#8217;s up to him.  I wonder how uncomfortable things will get in the full house now that they don&#8217;t work together anymore but she still lives in the attic.  It&#8217;ll also be interesting to see how things change now that Danny is unemployed and unable to support a big mob of useless people.  How long before these people start eating each other, I wonder?  Anyway, after trying to offer helpful suggestions, Joey starts whining again about how they stopped manufacturing his stupid fucking cookies, which is like the lamest subplot of all time.</p>
<p>Danny walks in and asks everyone what they&#8217;re watching and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;uh&#8230;nothing.&#8221;  He&#8217;s carrying a big bottle and for a second I thought that he&#8217;s been trying to drown his sorrows in sweet, sweet liquor but he&#8217;s actually just trying to pass the time by failing to make a ship in a bottle.  Yeah, in the context of this show, I guess that makes more sense.  Full House is a series that&#8217;s so g-rated that a man will only try to drown his sorrows in a bottle by building a model ship in it.</p>

<p>The waiter asks the table if anyone else would like some dessert and then Joey starts whining yet again about those fucking cookies.  Michelle orders a big brownie, which DJ and Stephanie eye desperately, which leads to them making a truce by agreeing to both break their no sweets bet at the same time.  Finally, they share a piece of cookie crumble cheesecake while making unsettling moaning sounds.</p>

<p>Danny admits that he was being a shithead and says that he was just upset because he got passed over in front of Michelle.  Michelle asks if she can read her report now and he says sure, so she pulls it out from under the table, where she&#8217;d been keeping it that whole time for some reason.</p>
