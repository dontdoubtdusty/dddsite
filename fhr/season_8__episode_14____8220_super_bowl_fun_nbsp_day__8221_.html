<p>As DJ anal-retentively prepares the living room for her interview, Joey waltzes in after being on the road doing comedy for several weeks (never mind how he was able to miss his radio DJ job all that time, or if he even still has that job) and sits down to watch the Super Bowl.  DJ tells him to get the fuck out of there because he&#8217;s already been enough of a hindrance on her life and she really doesn&#8217;t need him fucking up her scholarship interview on top of everything else but he pleads with her and mentions that her dad and Becky are going to be hosting the Super Bowl pre-game show because of course they are.  DJ says that&#8217;s cool and everything but she&#8217;s gonna tape it and watch it later and then Joey finally agrees to watch the game up in his room.</p>

<p>Joey tries to weasel out of his obligation by asking Jesse if he can&#8217;t just take the kids to the museum by himself and then suddenly, as if on cue, all of the kids run in all at once (never mind why some other parent was able to transport that many kids all together but is unwilling to help with the museum trip.  Also never mind that that&#8217;s way more kids than you could possibly fit into one car) and start crowding around Jesse and pulling on him, which is pretty weird.</p>

<p>Michelle and her little friends, left wholly unattended in a creepy sports bar, try to find ways to keep themselves entertained.  They decide to grab a remote so they can try to find a science channel on one of the tv&#8217;s because they&#8217;re all really into science as of this episode.  Derek changes the channel and then there&#8217;s some pretty sweet footage of the majestic blue-footed booby doing its distinctive mating dance on screen.  Anyone who knows anything about science knows that the blue-footed booby loves to fuck.</p>

<p>Becky and Danny come back onscreen again and make another attempt to check out the room that the scoreboard is operated from.  They find the correct room this time but then the alarm goes off when they try to open the door because I guess that they didn&#8217;t think to coordinate anything with anyone.  Who even gives a shit about seeing the room that the scoreboard is operated from anyway?  The best part is that after the onscreen folly, Stephanie denies to the barflys that Danny is her father.  I guess she&#8217;s finally getting to that age where she&#8217;s cognizant enough to be ashamed of Danny.</p>
<p>Jesse puts together a demonstration for the kids about haircare and they&#8217;re like &#8220;fuck this shit&#8221; and decide to go downstairs to watch the Super Bowl.  DJ shoos them into the kitchen with the barflys but then the scholarship lady shows up at the back door, which DJ probably should have anticipated because people seem to come in through the backyard for no reason pretty frequently.  DJ hastily ushers everyone back out to the living room and then opens the door for the scholarship lady, who&#8217;s played by Mimi from the Drew Carey show.</p>

Mimi asks if there&#8217;s a Super Bowl party going on in the other room and DJ assures her that there isn&#8217;t even though it totally doesn&#8217;t make any sense that it would effect her chances of getting a scholarship if people were watching the Super Bowl in her house during the interview.  I mean, really, this whole premise is just completely ridiculous.  Anyway, it turns out that Mimi is a big football fan so she hastily awards DJ the scholarship so she can watch the game in the other room, which is such a delightful twist, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Now that everyone is finally watching the game in peace, Michelle decides to go sulk in the kitchen, so Joey follows her for a very special talk.  He explains to her that sometimes things don&#8217;t turn out the way that you planned and that she needs to learn how to handle that, which is actually the best advice that anyone&#8217;s ever given her.  Being the evil mastermind that she is, though, Michelle just turns Joey&#8217;s moral around on him by pointing out that he had an obligation that he shirked because he wanted to watch the Super Bowl, making him a hypocrite.  The music comes on as Joey realizes that he was a real shithead for putting some little kids field trip that could have easily been rescheduled aside so that he could watch the biggest sports event of the year instead.  He apologizes and they agree to go to the museum the following weekend, which they should have just done in the first place, for sucks sake, and then they go back into the living room to watch the Super Bowl with everyone.</p>

<p>Also, I&#8217;ve gotten about ten million messages about a few articles over the past few weeks.  Apparently the Full House sequel series is a hoax, which is all the same to me because there was no way I was gonna watch that shit anyway.  And, yes, I have seen the articles about Derek growing up to be a gay go-go dancer.  I can&#8217;t say that I was surprised.  See, i wasn&#8217;t razzing him for being gay, I was just stating the obvious.  Maybe we could all go see him and have that be the close-out party?  I&#8217;ll stuff the Season 8 DVD box set in his little banana hammock.</p>
