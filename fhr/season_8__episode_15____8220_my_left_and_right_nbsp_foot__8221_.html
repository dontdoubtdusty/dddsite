<p>Lisa, who we haven&#8217;t seen in a while, walks into Michelle&#8217;s room and finds her measuring her feet.  Michelle tells her about the totally ridiculous premise of the episode and Lisa says that she can help her shrink her feet.</p>
<p>Becky comes upstairs and tells Jesse that she&#8217;s written a list of songs to sing to the twins because she&#8217;s just so excited about singing all of a sudden.  Jesse says that he&#8217;s written her a special part that he wants to practice with her, which is of course a ruse so he can secretly coach her.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lisa wraps Michelle&#8217;s feet in shrink wrap and then convinces her to stand in ice water.</p>

<p>Danny tells an uninteresting anecdote about how he used to be teased for being tall, making the point that everyone is different and it&#8217;s nothing to be ashamed of (except that Danny totally should be ashamed of being the way he is.  Maybe not physically, but in every other way for sure.).  Joey says that his head is shaped like a toe, which is why kids used to say that he was &#8220;toe headed,&#8221; and then Danny patronizingly explains that &#8220;towheaded&#8221; is an expression used to describe kids with very blond hair.  I guess you can&#8217;t really blame Danny&#8217;s tone here because how the fuck did Joey go his whole life without learning that?  Anyway, Danny tells Michelle that she&#8217;s beautiful and normal and then they hug and the audience go, &#8220;aww.&#8221;  So, there you go: as long as you&#8217;re beautiful and normal, there&#8217;s nothing to worry about.</p>

It wasn&#8217;t the worst, but those were definitely two of the most ridiculous premises in the history of the show.  Either one would have been a real stretch as a b-story in any episode, but putting them together like that was a real achievement in absurdity.</p>
