<p>DJ and Kimmie Gibbler come home and tell everyone that they got Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to referee their school&#8217;s fundraiser basketball game.  How&#8217;d they get such a big celebrity to agree to this?  Don&#8217;t worry about it.  Anyway, since the entire fucking world revolves around the people on this show, DJ and Kimmie Gibbler have been picked to coach the celebrity teams.  Kimmie Gibbler&#8217;s team is from some random news station and DJ wants the dads to be her team because who else was it gonna be?  Also, they do all have jobs in the entertainment industry, so it does sort of make sense despite the fact that they&#8217;re all terrible at said jobs</p>
<p>Danny and Joey immediately agree to play in the game but Jesse is hesitant because he&#8217;s not into sports.  This is a relatively new aspect of his character, first alluded to in the Super Bowl episode a few shows back.  So, there you go: 8 Seasons in, these characters are still developing.  You may have thought that Jesse was just an Elvis-obsessed, self-absorbed, fried chicken eating negligent husband and father, but there&#8217;s always been an element to his character that was so subtle and nuanced that you never even knew about if for all these years.  He also doesn&#8217;t like sports.</p>
<p>Everyone spends about 30 seconds coercing Jesse into participating instead of finding some other d-list local celebrity who actually wants to be involved and wont fuck up their team.  Jesse finally agrees and makes plans with Joey and Danny to practice on the basketball court.</p>
<p>In the living room, Michelle asks Becky what you call a boy ladybug and Becky replies, &#8220;confused,&#8221; which is a totally trans-phobic joke.  Stephanie comes downstairs and gifts Becky with the terrible sweater that she made and insists that she wears it to the basketball game.  See?  If you give these fucking kids an inch, they walk all over you.  Not only does she force her to take ownership of the ugly sweater, she straight up tells her where and when to wear it.</p>

<p>Everyone decides to leave the basketball court but Jesse sticks around to practice because now he&#8217;s got a big inferiority complex.  He misses another shot and there&#8217;s a moment where you can totally see a crew member pick up the ball and throw it back to him.</p>

<p>As Jesse sits on the court and laments his total lack of basketball prowess, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar shows up, which gets the audience almost as excited as when they see a ball go through a basketball hoop.</p>

<p>Kareem, who must not have anything better to do, decides to give Jesse some pointers.  They putz around for a while and eventually discover that there&#8217;s a specific spot on the court from which Jesse can make a basket.  He scores a few shots and the audience lose their shit each time.  Kareem advises him to make shots only from that specific spot during the game because it&#8217;s his only chance of scoring.</p>

<p>After a lively montage, DJ calls a time out and explains that the teams are tied and the next point will win the game because that&#8217;s how every sporting event turns out in every tv show ever made.  Jesse pleads with everyone to let him try to make the winning point so he can impress his kids because that&#8217;s all he cares about and DJ reasons that it&#8217;s such an unexpected strategy that it just might work.  When the time comes, a member of the opposing team is standing on Jesse&#8217;s special spot but he tries to make the shot anyway from a slightly different spot and ends up winning the game.</p>
<p>Everyone sings Jesse&#8217;s praises and then he goes over to his kids to soak up more glory but it turns out that they were off taking a piss while he scored the winning basket.  One of the twins says, &#8220;I went number one,&#8221; and then the other one says, &#8220;I watched,&#8221; which is&#8230; pretty weird.  Jesse gets all agitated because he only participated in the game to try to impress his stupid kids in the first place but then the music comes on as Becky explains that it doesn&#8217;t matter how much of a ridiculous loser he is, he&#8217;s those mentally deficient twins&#8217; dad and they&#8217;ll love him no matter how bad he sucks.</p>

<p>Oh hey so I booked the San Francisco FHR close-out party!  It&#8217;s going to be at the <a href="http://www.elriosf.com/">El Rio</a> on Saturday, December 21st.  I&#8217;ll do a slideshow and Q&amp;A from 7-8 PM and then they&#8217;re gonna kick us out of the back room but we can hang out and drink all muthafuckin night.  If less than 40 people come they&#8217;re gonna charge me for the space so bring your friends and/or maybe throw in a couple bucks on that fee.  I have absolutely no idea how many people are gonna show up to this thing.  I&#8217;m also working on the final close-out party in Portland, OR the weekend of the final review, January 17, and will have more info about it shortly.  If you&#8217;d like to learn more, please join the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Full-House-Reviewed/116296178418358?ref=hl">official FHR Facebook page</a>.</p>
