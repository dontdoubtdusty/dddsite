                        <h1>Season 8, Episode 17, &#8220;Dateless in San Francisco&#8221;</h1>

                        <p>Pre-Credits Gag:  Jesse teaches the twins how to make valentines for Becky.  They present them to her and it turns out that Jesse fucked up when he made his.  Joey being dumber than a small child is a schtick that&#8217;s as old as the series itself, but Jesse being this inept is kind of new.  I mean, he&#8217;s always been pretty pathetic, but it&#8217;s been growing exponentially lately.  He really seems to be completely falling apart as the series winds down.</p>

<p>Michelle and her little friends discuss the Valentine&#8217;s dance and Lisa decides that they all need to have dates.  She picks Derek as her date, surely commencing what will be a lifetime of pursuing unattainable partners, and then she assigns Michelle and Teddy to each other.  Now that I think about it, there&#8217;s a pretty good chance that Teddy&#8217;s gay, too.  I never really noticed before because his potential gayness is a like a mere candle next to the blinding supernova of Derek&#8217;s undeniable homosexuality, but he definitely has some homopotential.  It&#8217;s pretty interesting that these are the love interests that these girls end up with.  They also set up Aaron Bailey with Sophia, who&#8217;s just some girl we&#8217;ve never seen before that doesn&#8217;t even say anything interesting.</p>

<p>Becky and Jesse sit around eating sandwiches and soaking up their mundane coexistence and then Danny comes down to discuss his Valentine&#8217;s Day plans with Claire.  Oh, yeah, I totally forgot that Danny&#8217;s been stickin&#8217; it to Gia&#8217;s mom.  Jesse tells Danny that he&#8217;ll help him make a romantic plan because he&#8217;s such an amorous fellow and then, when Becky asks him what he has planned for her, he&#8217;s like, &#8220;well, we&#8217;ve been married for a while, so I totally don&#8217;t give a shit about doing something nice for you?&#8221;  The only thing I find at all surprising about this scenario is the notion that Jesse ever made any effort in the past to be romantic on Valentine&#8217;s day.  The idea here is that the magic&#8217;s gone, but, what magic?</p>
<p>Michelle tells DJ about how Teddy is her boyfriend now and then Stephanie comes home with some incredibly weird looking boy.  He carries her bag for her and makes goo-goo eyes before giving her an innocuous kiss on the cheek and telling her that he&#8217;ll call her later.</p>

<p>Teddy comes over and wants to thumb wrestle with Michelle but she says that they can&#8217;t do stuff like that anymore because they&#8217;re girlfriend and boyfriend now.  She tries to come up with ideas for activities that are appropriate for their new status and decides that he should call her on the phone, which requires him to go home first.</p>

<p>Teddy calls and Michelle tells him to come back over to the full house with candy and flowers.  Most guys are pushovers for their first girlfriends anyway but when that first girlfriend is Michelle you get straight up railed on.</p>
<p>Jesse comes downstairs and proposes some really romantic Valentine&#8217;s Day ideas and then when Becky gets all touched by it he&#8217;s like, &#8220;naw, sucka, these are ideas for what Danny should do for Claire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Michelle laments her expired relationship in her room and then DJ and Kimmie Gibbler come in and ask her what&#8217;s wrong.  Michelle fills them in and then asks, &#8220;DJ, can you help me?  Guys are always breaking up with you&#8230;&#8221;  Oh my god what an asshole!  It&#8217;s never a good idea to insult someone right to their face as a prelude to asking for counsel.  Becky comes in and gets filled in on the situation, which sparks a communal pity party about how shitty men are.  Eventually Stephanie comes in and says that the really stupid looking kid who walked her home never called, which only adds flame to the fire.  Men are just the shittiest!</p>

<p>A hot air balloon ride, huh?  Well, at least we can all say that we didn&#8217;t see that coming.  So is this supposed to make up for just the stagnant relationship ruse this episode or for their entire relationship so far?  Anyway, Becky says that she actually believed him when he said he didn&#8217;t give a shit about doing romantic stuff for her (again, probably due to their entire relationship so far) and then the music comes on as he tells her that as long as she pays for everything and puts up with his stupid bullshit, they&#8217;ll always have gentle music to guide them through their 22-minute misunderstandings.  Finally, there are some really hokey shots of a hot air balloon flying over the city during the daytime even though it was totally nighttime when they took off from the backyard.</p>

<p>Marcia Wallace asks Joey to dance and then he tries to return the excessive pile of candy and flowers that he thinks that she sent to him.  She interprets it as him gifting her with these items and starts trying to make out with him, which tips Joey off that the gifts weren&#8217;t from her.</p>

<p>Hey, I just realized that we never even saw Claire during this episode.  What the fuck?  She must be dead, just like all the other discarded love interests.  I bet that Danny&#8217;s romantic date with her was just like that Tom Petty video.</p>
