<p>The girls think about who to enlist for their band and Gia suggests some girl that&#8217;s never been seen or mentioned before as the drummer and Stephanie says that she&#8217;d be perfect because she has no life.  They ponder over who their keyboard player could be, which is an essential addition to any band, and Jesse reluctantly suggests Kimmie Gibbler.</p>
<p>Once Kimmie Gibbler and some girl with no discernible characteristics are enlisted to the band, they start to jam out and Jesse is dismayed by how hard they suck.</p>

<p>Stephanie and her band perform (and by perform I mean unconvincingly lip-synch) that timeless Ace of Base classic, &#8220;I Saw the Sign.&#8221;  Even though their terrible cover was on par with any of the terrible covers that Jesse has performed over the years, he insists that they need to rehearse a lot more before the talent competition.  They refer to him as &#8220;uncle slave driver&#8221; and duck out to the mall to pick out outfits for their performance.</p>

<p>Jesse comes in and tells the girls that they need to rehearse more but they&#8217;re all just like, &#8220;fuck that shit.&#8221;  Jesse, behaving responsibly and employing a work ethic for the first time in his entire life, continues to push them to practice, which leads to him and Stephanie having quite the argument.  Stephanie finally tells him that they don&#8217;t need him as their manager and Gia and Kimmie Gibbler agree while the blonde drummer girl just kind of stands there, having no lines and no character to work with.  I guess that having no life really is her defining characteristic.  Jesse walks out and then Stephanie looks wistfully towards the door while sad music plays.  The weirdest part is that the other girls immediately go back to posing purposefully in the background, which would seem odd even if it wasn&#8217;t in contrast to Stephanie&#8217;s heavy handed dramatic moment.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t believe me, they straight up sing &#8220;Don&#8217;t Go Breakin&#8217; My Heart.&#8221;  Seriously, this show just can&#8217;t get enough of pointing out how gay this kid Derek is.  I know that I talk about it a lot, but they just wont stop baiting me, constantly.  This performance makes the video that Elton John made with RuPaul for this song in the 90&#8217;s look like an episode of Baywatch, it&#8217;s so goldarn homosexual.</p>

<p>The weirdest thing about the performance is this one shot of the audience&#8217;s reaction.  They look mildly dazed and uninterested, and one old guy is half-heartedly clapping along.  Why would they show us that?</p>

<p>Becky and Danny announce that the winners of the talent show are Lisa and Derek, because it&#8217;s not like some extra was gonna win it.</p>

<p>Also, there&#8217;s an official Facebook event invite up for the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1418871728347091/">San Francisco Full House Reviewed Close-out event at the El Rio on December 21</a>.  Be sure to RSVP, y&#8217;all!  See you in a few weeks!  I&#8217;m also wrapping up the planning for the final event in Portland, OR.  It&#8217;s looking like it&#8217;ll be on January 24&#8230; More on that next week!</p>
