                        <p>Add this to the list of episode titles that could be a euphemism for anal sex.  Also, this episode is the first one on the last disc of the series.  I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m almost done with this shit.  I&#8217;ll miss you guys and everything, but boy can I not wait for this dumb ass garbage to be over.</p>

<p>Nelson comes over to see DJ and Michelle makes a bunch of really shitty and insensitive remarks about how DJ dumped him, right to his face.  DJ comes downstairs and wants to know why Nelson is there and he tells her that his cousin is in town coordinating the Queen&#8217;s reception and that he wants DJ to come with him. DJ expresses excitement about meeting the Queen and then Joey enters the scene just to tool around but then Nelson invites him to come to the reception, too, because his cousin needs a date, which is, like, the worst plan I&#8217;ve ever heard.  I guess Nelson really hates his cousin.  And the Queen.</p>

<p>Danny comes in and tells DJ that she got a letter from Stanford.  She gets all excited even though it&#8217;s just a regular-sized envelope, which always means that you didn&#8217;t get in.  Acceptance letters come in big packages.  That&#8217;s one of those facts that tv shows always ignore.  Anyway, it turns out that DJ didn&#8217;t get accepted into Stanford (so the envelope is actually authentic.  Take that, me!), but Danny tells her that it&#8217;s ok because she already got into Berkeley, so if the show gets picked up for another Season it&#8217;ll still be easy for her to be a regular cast member.  Regardless of the fact that she&#8217;s already been accepted to one of the top schools in the country, DJ is pretty disappointed by her rejection from Stanford, most likely because she comes from a woefully entitled family that never prepared her for any type of rejection.</p>

<p>As DJ sits and enjoys a sandwich, Nelson comes over with a book for Joey with the hope that it will prepare him to not make a total asshole of himself when he meets the Queen.  Yeah, good luck with that.  The only way to prevent Joey from fucking up everything when he meets the Queen is to not invite him to meet the Queen.  DJ tells Nelson that she&#8217;s feeling a little better about being rejected from Stanford and then he shows her some fancy diamond earrings that she can wear when she meets the Queen, which lightens her mood even more.  The phone rings and it&#8217;s Kimmie Gibbler, who&#8217;s calling from Reno because she&#8217;s about to marry her incredibly uninteresting boyfriend.</p>

Would that make you worry less than just not knowing where she is at all?  Anyway, it doesn&#8217;t matter because the minute that DJ leaves, the dog starts chewing on the note, which may or may not be a plot device&#8230;</p>

<p>Michelle finds the chewed up note and gives it to Danny, who deduces from it&#8217;s weathered condition and mostly illegible state that it&#8217;s a letter saying that DJ has gone to Reno to marry Nelson.</p>

<p>Joey totally fails to show his date a good time at the Queen&#8217;s reception, which wasn&#8217;t, like, totally predictable or anything.  It&#8217;s weird that Nelson agreed to miss meeting the Queen so that he could help DJ stop Kimmie Gibbler from getting married.  Not only does that seem like a pretty big event to pass up, but he also totally stuck his cousin alone with Joey.  It&#8217;s also weird that this is even happening at all.  I mean, really, where did this premise come from?</p>

I just want to get one shot!&#8221; which, unsurprisingly, leads to the security staff forcing him onto the ground.  Although that set up was totally ridiculous, it is pretty neat to see Joey being forcibly restrained.  Unfortunately, this was before Gitmo, or this could have been the best storyline ever.  I&#8217;m totally anti-Gitmo, by the way.  Except for this one case, where it would have been great.</p>
