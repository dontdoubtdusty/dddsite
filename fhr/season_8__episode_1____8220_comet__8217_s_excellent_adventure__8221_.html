                        <h1>Season 8, Episode 1, &#8220;Comet&#8217;s Excellent Adventure&#8221;</h1>
                        <p><em>Original Date: 2013-08-09</em></p>

                        <p>Pre-Credits Gag:  The family all search frantically for the remote until the dog comes in holding it in his mouth, almost as if to say, &#8220;anyone remember that this family has a dog?&#8221;  They turn on the tv and it turns out that, in a bizarre meta-moment, they&#8217;re sitting down to watch Full House.  I guess it&#8217;s not at all surprising that these self-obsessed assholes would sit around and watch their own shitty show together.  The pre-credits gag ends there but I&#8217;d be willing to bet that they all start beating off to themselves about 2 seconds later.  It&#8217;s also weird that you get a view of the 4th wall here, especially given the meta-circumstances.</p>

<p>Jesse gets together with his shitty band to rehearse but they&#8217;re interrupted by the twins clanging away at their toy instruments.  That one member of the band who I&#8217;m pretty sure is the only consistent constituent (you know, the one with the curly hair) says what I think is his first ever line of dialogue when he tells Jesse that his stupid ugly kids are fucking up their rehearsal.  Jesse addresses him as Gary, so I guess we&#8217;re finally learning his name after 8 years.  Wow, he received a name and a line of dialogue all in the same scene, and it only took 8 years of regular appearances to make it happen?  Someone get this man a SAG membership!</p>

<p>Jesse cancels band practice to go down to the radio station but then Roger Lodge approaches him to let him know that the rest of the members of his shitty band have taken a vote and decided to kick him out because they&#8217;re tired of his pushy obnoxious family ruining everything all the god damned time.  As Gary hangs up his keytar for the final time, Jesse pleads with them to stay, addressing them all by name, including one guy that he calls Lonnie who corrects him by telling him that his name is Lannie.  I&#8217;m not sure if Jesse&#8217;s supposed to get this guys name wrong because he&#8217;s just the latest in the endless revolving door of band members throughout the series or because he&#8217;s such a narcissistic asshole that he could play in a band with a guy for 8 years without every bothering to learn his name.</p>
<p>Sad music plays and the audience goes &#8220;aww&#8221; as Jesse is justly abandoned by his talentless bandmates.  He takes a seat to feel sorry for himself and then one of the twins asks him, &#8220;tattufasswannapaynemoah?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jesse stews in the aftermath of being justly kicked out of his maladroit band as Becky patiently listens and reassures him because codependency is like second nature to her at this point.  Jesse decides that he&#8217;s going to continue making shitty music on his own, a misguided notion that Becky fully enables.</p>
<p>Danny chases after Comet, who&#8217;s carrying a string of sausages in his mouth that Danny was going to cook for dinner. Why would he even want those sausages anymore after they were in the dogs mouth?  Danny realizes that the dog is pilfering food because Jesse neglected to feed him when it was his turn to do so but Jesse just tells Danny to fuck off because he&#8217;s too busy being mad about getting kicked out of his band to spend 5 seconds of his day fulfilling his facile responsibilities even though he doesn&#8217;t even pay rent.  I&#8217;m actually a little surprised that Becky didn&#8217;t preemptively do his dog feeding job for him.  Danny tells him that it&#8217;s going to be his turn to walk the dog tomorrow but before Jesse can dodge this minimal obligation with more self-pity, Michelle offers to do it for him.  Danny tells her that she&#8217;s too small to walk the dog by herself and also that Jesse has to do it because that motherfucker has been living in his house for 8 years and all he&#8217;s ever expected to contribute is occasional menial tasks that service the plot of the episode.</p>
<p>Jesse pleads on the phone with a booking agent to let him play a gig somewhere even though he owns his own club that he can perform at whenever he wants and then Michelle comes in and tells him that Comet&#8217;s about to shit all over the floor if he doesn&#8217;t take him for his walk.  All Jesse cares about is getting Michelle to back up off his nuts so he can talk on the phone so he tells her to go walk the dog herself.  Why doesn&#8217;t she just let the dog shit in the backyard?</p>
<p>Michelle takes Comet out for the series&#8217; only on-location shots of San Francisco.  Comet is abruptly compelled to chase after a Volkswagen Bug that has a hot dog on top of it for some reason (I can&#8217;t tell what this is supposed to be&#8230; it can&#8217;t be a delivery vehicle because it&#8217;s too small, so what is it?) and so he breaks free of Michelle grip and runs off.</p>

<p>Comet continues to chase the wiener car until he spots a fine ass bitch and then they run off together to go fuck.</p>

<p>Jesse constructs an elaborate set-up in the basement so he can try to perform as a one-man band but then all of his equipment starts malfunctioning and bursting into flames and stuff.  Although I&#8217;m loathe to give Jesse credit in any situation, his failure here seems much more due to faulty wiring than his shortcomings as a musician.</p>

<p>Becky and Jesse stand in front of the camera for a special live afternoon edition of Wake Up, San Francisco because it&#8217;s convenient for the plot.  Why would they have to do a special afternoon edition just to go to the wharf?  I&#8217;d understand doing a special live show if the president was shot or something, but you can go to the wharf any old time.  Actually, I guess only a real news show would do a special live show for a big news event, not some crappy morning show.  So I guess I can&#8217;t think of any reason for them to ever be doing a live show in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Anyway, regardless of when or where it&#8217;s filmed, Wake Up, San Francisco is always a disaster.  As soon as they start their very special coverage of street performers, Jesse and Joey interrupt the taping to tell Danny that the dog ran away.  Moments later, all of the girls show up because they had the same idea to ruin Danny&#8217;s live taping by telling him about the stupid dog running away and pretty soon the whole show becomes a lost dog PSA even though nobody watching at home could possibly give a shit.</p>
