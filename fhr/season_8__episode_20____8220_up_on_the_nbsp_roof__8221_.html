<p>Michelle comes downstairs and demands that Danny makes her an elaborate breakfast but he&#8217;s like, &#8220;tough shit.  I&#8217;m in a hurry, so your ass is eatin&#8217; a bagel.&#8221;  Michelle&#8217;s like, &#8220;fuck all y&#8217;all, I&#8217;ma get up early tomorrow an&#8217; make my own muthafuckin&#8217; breakfast,&#8221; but then she realizes that she doesn&#8217;t know how to cook.  Becky offers to teach her how but then Jesse&#8217;s all, &#8220;bitch, yo&#8217; ass can&#8217;t cook for shit,&#8221; and then Becky&#8217;s like, &#8220;fuck you, asshole. Who are you to criticize me when I&#8217;ve been supporting your worthless ass all these years, you greasy bastard?&#8221;  Becky mentions a fine dinner that she made for them in the past but then Danny and Jesse allude to all of the horrible shits that they took after they ate it, then Becky makes a very clear allusion to the fact that she&#8217;s not gonna fuck Jesse later because he&#8217;s being such a shithead, which is actually pretty awesome.</p>

<p>Becky and Michelle make plans to prepare dinner together later and then everyone but Jesse leaves because they all have actual responsibilities.  Kimmie Gibbler comes over and DJ tells her the idea that she thought up for their senior prank, which is to print up a fake school newspaper with joke articles.  Jesse tells her that her idea&#8217;s tame even by this show&#8217;s standards and then he briefs her about how, when he was a student at her school, he stole the principal&#8217;s toupee and sent it up the flag pole.  DJ and Kimmie Gibbler both say that they&#8217;ve heard all about that legendary prank but didn&#8217;t know that Jesse was the culprit and then they&#8217;re inspired to think up a really good prank of their own. DJ says that she&#8217;s super nervous about trying to pull off an ambitious prank because pranksters could potentially be expelled and not get into college if they&#8217;re caught, plus she&#8217;s, like, a total fucking square who never does anything remotely naughty.</p>

<p>DJ has Dwayne lift the principal&#8217;s car onto the roof of the school with the big crane, which has got to be the most conspicuous prank imaginable.  Regardless, it goes off without a hitch and all the kids are pretty excited about pulling off the greatest prank ever.</p>

<p>Back on the roof, Jesse hotwires the car and raises the hood with ease.  Kimmie Gibbler warns Jesse and DJ that a security guard is approaching so Jesse urges the girls to hide and let him take the rap.  Where was this security guard when they were lifting the car onto the roof with a big ass crane?  Jesse is apprehended and DJ is filled with guilt, but Kimmie Gibbler doesn&#8217;t give a shit at all.</p>
