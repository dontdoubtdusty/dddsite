                        <p>I feel like I&#8217;m a senior in high school and I already took the SATs and got into college and all that shit and now I&#8217;m just waiting for the year to be over because I&#8217;m so close and it pretty much doesn&#8217;t even matter anymore.  Senioritis, they call it.  After this episode there are only two more&#8230;  can&#8217;t we just say I reviewed them all? Do we really have to go through these last ones?  Haven&#8217;t I done enough???</p>
<p>Oh, ok, fine.</p>
<p>Pre-Credits Gag:  Michelle refuses to help DJ do the dishes but then DJ hustles her in a game of jacks so Michelle has to do them all herself.</p>

Good move!</p>

<p>Jesse hears more horrible noises emanating from Kimmie Gibbler&#8217;s back yard and she pops up and tells him that she borrowed an ostrich from her uncle and, since it&#8217;s mating season, the creature will be making guttural sounds of unrequited lust for the next 8 weeks.  Jesse rants about the situation while he stands next to the fence and then he&#8217;s bitten by an ostrich puppet.  The puppet&#8217;s actually not half bad.  That&#8217;s not to say that it&#8217;s a great effect but rather that the bar has been set pretty goddamn low.</p>

Just then, Gia barges into the house without knocking or anything and tells Stephanie that the whole school knows that Danny confronted Ryan and made him apologize to Stephanie.  There&#8217;s also a game-of-telephone-esque exaggeration of how the scene played out that&#8217;s accumulated, but it doesn&#8217;t nullify the fact that Danny&#8217;s intervention is straight up humiliating for Stephanie.  The girls all chastise Danny, who defends himself by apologizing pathetically and then walking away all hangdog style, which makes the audience go, &#8220;aww.&#8221;  Well, I&#8217;m glad that they actually acknowledged how fucked up it was for Danny to get involved like that.  You can never tell how things are going to play out on this shitty, backwards-ass show.</p>
<p>Stephanie wonders how to handle her scheduled pizza date with Ryan and Gia suggests that she stand him up since he allegedly doesn&#8217;t want to meet up with her anyway.</p>
<p>As Jesse begins to plan construction of a large soundproof wall in the back yard, he is pulled over the fence by the ostrich, who starts raping him.</p>
