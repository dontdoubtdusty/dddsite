<p>Jesse and Joey come home and tell Becky that they&#8217;re auditioning for their own late night tv show.  I guess that since they&#8217;ve both managed to stumble onto several show business jobs already without any talent or work ethic, they might as well go after this next opportunity, too.  Their plan is to host a show where they go and interview people with unusual jobs and their first subject is a team of wrestlers.  Becky wonders if Jesse isn&#8217;t over-committing himself, as he&#8217;s already got 2 careers that he&#8217;s terrible at, plus he&#8217;s a terrible husband and father, but Jesse assure her that he&#8217;ll still be able to maintain the low standard that he&#8217;s provided for so many years.</p>

<p>Stephanie&#8217;s acting partner comes over to rehearse and Michelle refuses to leave the room while they practice their scene.  They get to the kiss and Stephanie&#8217;s partner hesitates, at which point Michelle starts making a bunch of shitty remarks about how dry Stephanie&#8217;s lips are.</p>

<p>Michelle <strong></strong>approaches Jesse to discuss her concerns about her upcoming jumping competition.  He tells her that he&#8217;s hella busy with all of his responsibilities because he&#8217;s actually taking them seriously for the first time in his life so he doesn&#8217;t really have time to listen to her stupid trivial problems, plus he can&#8217;t make it to her competition.  He tells her that she&#8217;ll do fine and then shoos her away before Joey approaches him to practice wrestling moves for their upcoming tv audition.</p>

<p>As the competition begins, Danny notices that his hideous demon of a daughter isn&#8217;t there and so he and Joey rush off to find out why.  As they search for her, they run into Jesse, who&#8217;s like, &#8220;I decided to come because I remembered that Michelle is more important than my job and responsibilities.  Also, it&#8217;s convenient, story-wise.&#8221;  They ask some weird ranch hand if he saw where Michelle went and he directs them to the trail she went to but they never ask him why he let two little girls ride off unsupervised like that.  The ranch hand shows even more negligence as he sits idly by as all of the dads appropriate some horses so they can go after her.  Is this guy supposed to work there?  What&#8217;s his story?</p>

<p>FHR Wrap Party Update:  I hope to see a whole bunch of you guys at the <a href="http://www.thewaypost.com/">Waypost </a>in Portland, Oregon on Friday, January 24th at 9 PM for the final celebration of this project coming to a close.  I&#8217;ll make a Facebook event page for it and link to it next week.  For those of you who are curious about how the San Francisco party went, some super rad fans filmed the whole thing and I&#8217;ll be posting videos here soonish.  I&#8217;m planning on posting a lot of extra content during the final week of the blog so it&#8217;ll most likely go up then.</p>
<p>Like I did at the SF event, I&#8217;ll be reading a few posts from the site and then doing a Q and A.  Does anyone wanna suggest which reviews they&#8217;d like me to read?  At the first event I read &#8220;DJ&#8217;s Very First Horse&#8221; and &#8220;The Last Dance&#8221; (which is totally the best review ever) but I kinda think I should pick 2 different ones for this next one.  What do you guys think?</p>
<p>I hope to meet a lot of you then!  My big dream is that Teebore will come!  Fingers crossed!</p>
