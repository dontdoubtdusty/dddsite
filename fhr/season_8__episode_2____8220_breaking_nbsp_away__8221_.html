                        <p>Pre-Credits Gag:  Becky&#8217;s upset because it&#8217;s the twins&#8217; first day of preschool and then there&#8217;s some throwaway joke that&#8217;s not even worth mentioning that&#8217;s about how Joey&#8217;s an idiot.</p>

<p>Stephanie comes downstairs for school and Danny is alarmed by her whorish attire.  She tries to explain to him that it&#8217;s 1994 and therefore all teenage girls must have their midriffs exposed at all times, through rain, sleet or snow, but Danny aint havin&#8217; it.</p>

<p>As Stephanie remover her makeup in her room, Gia tells her to leave the mascara on because eyes are the first thing guys notice.  Stephanie asks is that&#8217;s true and Gia replies, &#8220;well&#8230; for now,&#8221; which is a joke that&#8217;s almost as gross and inappropriate as Stephanie&#8217;s exposed midriff from a couple minutes ago.  Danny comes upstairs to make sure that she no longer looks like a surefire candidate for teenage pregnancy and then he starts bitching at her about cleaning up her room.  He seems to want her to clean it up that very second and for some reason Stephanie never points out that she can&#8217;t because it&#8217;s time to go to school but, anyway, after he leaves she rebelliously decides that she&#8217;ll clean it when she feels like it.  This is about as close as the series ever gets to examining the unpleasant realities of having a dad with an obsessive compulsive cleaning disorder.  &#8220;I was late for school because I was cleaning.  CLEANING!!!&#8221;</p>
<p>After some really weird stock footage of children playing on a playground, Jesse escorts the twins to their preschool classroom.  For a second they seem a little apprehensive about starting preschool but then they see some toy trains and they&#8217;re so excited by them that they snub their dad when he asks for a goodbye kiss.  Jesse experiences separation anxiety and tries to stay in the classroom but the teacher edges him out of the door.  However, as soon as her back is turned, Jesse sneaks back into the classroom because he has no interest in boundaries or his children&#8217;s personal growth.</p>

<p>Becky comes home to find Jesse eating fried chicken in the living room and she apologizes for being such a weirdo about sending the kids to preschool.  Jesse neglects to admit that he was an even bigger weirdo about it and instead delivers some song and dance about how the kids weren&#8217;t ready for school and they should wait a few years until they try again.  He declares that he&#8217;s going to home-school the kids himself, with Joey&#8217;s help, and Becky kind of tries to resist for a second but by this point we all know how this type of shit goes down.</p>
<p>Stephanie throws all her shit all over the place in her room because that&#8217;s about as close to teenage rebellion as anyone gets on Full House.  Why can&#8217;t she just be caught doing whip-its in the school parking lot like a real teenager?  Why does everything have to be so bland?</p>
<p>Michelle decides that she wants to move into DJ&#8217;s room because Stephanie&#8217;s being such a gross slob.  DJ understands that Michelle is an unstoppable force of evil and there&#8217;s no resisting her malignant will so she tells Danny about how Stephanie&#8217;s room still looks like shit so he&#8217;ll cause a chain reaction that will result in Michelle choosing to move back into her old room of her own volition.</p>

<p>Jesse begins his first home schooling session with the kids, which of course includes Joey sitting with them and acting like a complete fucking idiot.</p>

<p>Becky, being the only reasonably intelligent person on this whole show, deduces that the kids didn&#8217;t have a problem with school and then she gets Jesse to admit that he pulled them out because they wouldn&#8217;t kiss him goodbye.  The music comes on as Becky displays an unreasonable amount of patience and tolerance for her husbands explanation of why he decided to forgo their children&#8217;s progress for the sake of his own feelings.  They decide to send the twins back to preschool but first they kiss them on the mouth a whole bunch.</p>

<p>Firsts:  One of the twins makes a statement that isn&#8217;t total fucking gibberish</p>
