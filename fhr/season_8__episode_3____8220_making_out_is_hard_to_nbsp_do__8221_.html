                        <p>Pre-Credits Gag:  Joey plays a trick on the twins but then it turns out that they were just humoring him, presumably out of pity.</p>

<p>Danny enters the room and starts making high pitched growling sounds, which calls for Stephanie clarifying that he&#8217;s got laryngitis.  She asks if she can go to Gia&#8217;s party and Danny asks via a notepad if there will be adult supervision there, at which point Gia tactfully withholds the truth.</p>
<p>Jesse and Joey host the radio show that they only ever work at when it&#8217;s convenient for the premise of the episode.  Joey introduces himself with a mouth full of &#8220;chocolate boing boings&#8221; (which I assume are supposed to be like Hostess snacks&#8230; R.I.P Hostess snacks&#8230; aw, man&#8230;why&#8217;d they have to remind me.  That&#8217;s a tragic loss that I&#8217;ll never get over&#8230;  I know what you&#8217;re thinking.  &#8220;There are plenty of knock offs.&#8221;  Well you know what?  They&#8217;re not the same.) because one of the rules of this show is that everyone has to be extremely terrible at their jobs all the time.</p>

<p>Greg Brady finally tells them to shut the fuck up and let him talk for 2 seconds and then he plugs his new band.  He busts out their CD and it&#8217;s revealed that he&#8217;s the new front man for the Rippers.  It&#8217;s kind of odd that none of the Rippers would have ever mentioned to Greg Brady that Jese was their old front man.  It&#8217;s made clear that Greg Brady isn&#8217;t going on the Rush Hour Renegades to be a dick about it, he just didn&#8217;t know.  Jesse tries to show what a good sport he is by playing the Rippers new CD on the air and then there are a series of shots of San Francisco as the song plays.</p>

<p>After an entirely unremarkable scene about Danny&#8217;s laryngitis, Stephanie asks DJ for a ride to Gia&#8217;s party.  DJ agrees to take her and then it turns out that Gia lives in the exact same building that Steve used to.  I get why they would just reuse the old set of Steve&#8217;s apartment (especially on this no money spendin&#8217; ass show), but did they have to use the same exterior shot, too?  They really couldn&#8217;t have found a different picture of a building to use?  That&#8217;s not cheap, it&#8217;s just lazy.</p>

<p>Stephanie is paired up with Bobby, who immediately starts trying to make out with her, what with this being a make out party and all.</p>

<p>DJ isn&#8217;t home to answer her phone because she literally dropped Stephanie off 3 minutes ago.  Danny hears it ringing and answers and Stephanie is unable to discern the difference between DJ&#8217;s voice and the way that Danny sounds when he has laryngitis so she starts divulging her circumstances into the phone.  She arranges to be picked up by Danny after providing way more incriminating information than she needed to and never realizing that he isn&#8217;t DJ.</p>
<p>Jesse does exactly what you&#8217;d expect him to after making a major life decision: lays down on the couch.</p>

There&#8217;s an interview with Becky and she opens by saying, &#8220;Ok, alright, so I married a failure.  I can deal with it.&#8221;  You know, it really wouldn&#8217;t have been any harder to sell that statement outside of a dream sequence.</p>

<p>Danny shows up at the make out party, hella mad.  Moments after he arrives, Gia&#8217;s mom shows up at the back door.  Wait, how is there a back door in an apartment like that?  Maybe they&#8217;re on the ground floor, but&#8230; no, it still doesn&#8217;t make sense.  Maybe if they&#8217;d gotten a new photo for the exterior of the building it wouldn&#8217;t seem so odd.  Anyway, all the make outers run away as soon as there are parents on the scene, leaving Gia and Stephanie alone with their single parents.  Danny is introduced to Gia&#8217;s mom, Claire, and then he starts lecturing her in his high pitched, scratchy voice.  Claire spoon feeds him some weird liquid that she has in her kitchen and it immediately cures him of his laryngitis.</p>

And what was the point of Danny having laryngitis for the whole episode anyway?  So he could be mistaken for DJ on the phone?  It would have made more sense, and spared us of this totally absurd miracle cure device, if he&#8217;d just been kicked in the nuts before answering DJ&#8217;s phone.  Plus then we&#8217;d have gotten to see him get kicked in the nuts.  Anyway, whatever.</p>
<p>Danny&#8217;s interrogates Claire about how her kid could host a make out party without her knowing and she&#8217;s like, &#8220;whatever, bitch, your kid was at that party and you didn&#8217;t know about it, either.&#8221; Danny and Claire reach an understanding and compare parenting tips and I guess we&#8217;re supposed to recognize some chemistry between them because this show seems to be on one last kamikaze mission to convince us that Danny is not gay.  Yeah, good luck with that.</p>
