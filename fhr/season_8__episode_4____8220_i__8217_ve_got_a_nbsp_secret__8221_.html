<p>Kimmie Gibbler walks into DJ&#8217;s room and&#8230; whoa, check out DJ&#8217;s incredibly dated computer.  What&#8217;s she even supposed to be doing on that thing?  Its processing power is literally 1/100th as strong as my phone, and my phone is old and shitty.</p>

YEARS!  I can only imagine the terrible behavior that children who watched this show were inspired to emulate, but this spitting shit has got to be the worst of it.  At least this time he&#8217;s spitting on an inanimate object instead of directly into someone&#8217;s face like he usually does, but it&#8217;s still disgusting.  The only consolation is that Danny immediately throws the knife in the garbage afterwards.</p>
<p>Jesse comes home with Becky and the twins and asks Stephanie why she&#8217;s using his KISS t-shirt to dry silverware.  She says that it was in the rag pile and he replies that it shouldn&#8217;t be because he was saving it for sentimental reasons.  Joey says that he used to love KISS and then he shouts &#8220;Rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll!&#8221; and sticks his tongue out, which makes the audience guffaw.</p>

<p>Becky deduces that the KISS t-shirt was a gift from some cooze that Jesse used to stick it to and she gets jealous.  She retaliates by recounting all the hot dick she used to get back in the day and then the argument escalates until they both decide that they&#8217;re going to make lists of everyone they ever fucked so they can compare them, which is maybe the worst idea I&#8217;ve ever heard in my life. At least now Becky will finally know the names of the women whose STD&#8217;s she&#8217;s contracted.</p>
<p>Michelle asks Danny for $39 dollars and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;fuck no,&#8221; then she asks Joey and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;sure,&#8221; and then he asks Danny to loan it to him.  If that doesn&#8217;t completely summarize their relationship, I don&#8217;t know what does.  Why doesn&#8217;t Joey have $39, anyway?  He&#8217;s got a good job and he doesn&#8217;t pay rent.  Anyway, Danny wants to know what the money is for so Michelle tells him about her secret club.  She makes a really big deal about how important it is to keep it a secret, which Danny seems to understand.  Danny says the he still wont buy her the toy because all his money is tied up in supporting all the people that live in his house who don&#8217;t pay for anything and then Joey tells her that all of the Super Fortresses are all sold out everywhere anyway, which is supposed to be funny because, you know, Joey plays with toys.  Pretty funny.</p>
<p>Nelson shows up at the full house to meet Kimmie Gibbler for their date, which seems like a pretty forced bit of staging although maybe it makes sense because Kimmie Gibbler&#8217;s trying to rub the whole thing in DJ&#8217;s face?  I can&#8217;t even tell anymore.  When everything&#8217;s so forced and absurd all the time it&#8217;s hard to tell when something justifiable occurs.  Kimmie Gibbler shows up looking hella fine and escorts Nelson and his enormous nostrils out the door for a long night of hot fucking.</p>
<p>Michelle and her stupid little friends hold another meeting of their secret club and then Danny comes in with a bowl of popcorn and totally spills the beans about knowing about their club.  The kids all get super pissed at Michelle for telling her dad about the club and expel her, which is probably the best decision they&#8217;ve ever made.</p>

And does Danny call her out on this?  Of course not.  He just sits there looking apologetic as sad music plays.  This is just like the time Michelle blamed Jesse for the dog running away after she walked him when she wasn&#8217;t supposed to. Maybe if they&#8217;d taught her a lesson about accountability then, she wouldn&#8217;t be pulling the same bullshit now.  When&#8217;s that very special lesson going to come up?  When&#8217;s some gentle music going to play as some adult sits her down and explains to her that she&#8217;s responsible for her own actions and can&#8217;t just go around blaming everyone else every time she fucks up.  Seriously, when the fuck&#8217;s that talk going to happen?</p>

<p>DJ sits down for a very special talk with Aunt Becky, who&#8217;s padding her list of guys that she fucked because she remembered what a total man whore Jesse was in the first Season.  DJ tells Becky about how she doesn&#8217;t like that Kimmie Gibbler is dating Nelson and Becky says that it&#8217;s normal to feel weird about shit like that but you can&#8217;t just be an asshole and claim some guy that you don&#8217;t even want.</p>

<p>Danny, Joey, and for some reason Jesse all wait for the toy store to open so they can buy a Super Fortress.  They are immediately trampled by the onslaught of eager consumers, many of whom are also probably trying to win their children&#8217;s love without going through all the trouble of learning any parenting skills.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an extended period of physical comedy that involves lots of clamoring and conflict with other parents and in the end the dads are unable to secure a Super Fortress.</p>
