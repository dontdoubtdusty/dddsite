I can&#8217;t tell if this is more or less out of left field than the time that Joey could fly a plane all of a sudden.</p>
<p>Michelle comes home all depressed because her teacher&#8217;s out for some reason that&#8217;s never mentioned and, since there are no substitute teachers, they just watch film strips all day.  Yeah, I remember being real sad as a kid when things fell through at school and we just got to sit around and watch movies instead of engaging in precious learning.  I&#8217;d go home with my head hanging down because I felt deprived of all the powerful knowledge I was used to receiving on a daily basis.  Anyway, Michelle&#8217;s like, &#8220;boy, it sure would be convenient if one of the characters on this show just happened to have a teaching degree that they&#8217;d never mentioned before for no reason,&#8221; and then Joey and Marcia Wallace are like, &#8220;damn, bitch, we we&#8217;re just talkin&#8217; bout that shit!&#8221; What are the odds!??!</p>
<p>Danny tries to convince Jesse to let him audition for his band by playing some &#8220;reggae&#8221; on his guitar that was more invasive and disrespectful towards Jamaican culture than centuries of British colonization.  Jesse realizes that Danny&#8217;s just going to keep bothering him all the time until he agrees to give him an audition so he acquiesces.</p>

<p>Joey tells all the kids to cut the shit but then Michelle keeps breaking his balls so he decides to make an example of her by sending her to the principals office.  Michelle&#8217;s like, &#8220;you can&#8217;t do that.  I&#8217;m the undisputed ruler of the entire goddamn universe, for fucks sake&#8221; but Joey actually sticks to his guns and gives her the boot.  Sad music plays as Michelle gathers her belongings and then tells Joey that he can go suck a dick because, as we&#8217;ve seen so many times before, she has absolutely no concept of accountability whatsoever.</p>

<p>Stephanie, DJ and Kimmie Gibbler all talk about how much they wanna bang all the filthy musicians who are at the full house to audition for Jesse&#8217;s band even though it&#8217;s been made abundantly clear over and over again that none of those broads put out.  Well, maybe Kimmie Gibbler does&#8230;  Danny shows up and hears the cliched names that all the other butt rockers have, like &#8220;Scab,&#8221; and decides that he needs a ridiculous moniker as well, so he dubs himself &#8220;Mildew.&#8221;</p>

<p>Michelle and her annoying friends show up for another day of having Joey as a substitute teacher.  The four of them all agree that they hate his guts now and decide to give him the silent treatment and since they seem to run some sort of collective hive-mind in their classroom, all the other kids go along with it even though there&#8217;s never any discussion about it or anything.</p>
