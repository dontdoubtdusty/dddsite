<p>As Stephanie works on making a 3-dimensional map of the United States out of plaster or something, Danny comes in and mentions how hot it is outside, then he starts beating off under the table while he describes the sweaty construction workers that he just saw working with their shirts off outside.</p>

<p>Just so we don’t completely forget about the uncles’ radio DJ jobs, Joey suggests that they hold a contest where they ask people to recite the lyrics to popular tv show themes.  This leads to Jesse singing the theme to 3&#8217;s Company, which gets the audience all riled up for some reason.  The joke here, which I have to mention because it&#8217;s going to come up about ten billion more times over the next 20 minutes, is that Jesse can&#8217;t remember a portion of the lyrics and just says &#8220;the thing and the thing and the thing&#8221; instead.  Pretty funny, huh?  If you don&#8217;t think so now, maybe you just need to hear it over and over and over again.  Anyway, for whatever reason, the twins really like it when Jesse sings this song and pester him to repeat it.  Jesse says that when you hear something too many times it becomes annoying, which is pretty goddamn ironic when you think of his countless utterances of, &#8220;have mercy,&#8221; not to mention all of the other tedious catchphrases that this show has been milking for years.  I do have to wonder whether this isn&#8217;t some meta-commentary by the writers, or if they were just completely lacking in self-awareness here.  Anyway, the twins sing the 3&#8217;s Company theme with Jesse and it&#8217;s pretty excruciating, what with their inability to speak clearly and all.  I guess that’s sort of their own repetitive catchphrase.  Indecipherable gibberish.</p>
<p>DJ reclaims a shirt of hers from Stephanie that she wants to wear for picture day tomorrow and then Michelle comes in and tells everyone that she made $221 dollars at her lemonade stand and they&#8217;re all like, &#8220;say whaaaaaaaat???&#8221;</p>

<p>Jesse is once again coerced into singing the 3&#8217;s Company theme to the twins, which is a routine that ages less like a fine wine and more like a fresh turd.  Danny asks if Michelle&#8217;s back yet and then the girls inform him that she was carrying fat stacks of dolla dolla bills when she went to the candy store, which he didn&#8217;t know about.  Just then, as if on cue, Michelle comes home and reveals that she bought a donkey with her money.  That&#8217;s right, a donkey.</p>

<p>Stephanie says she likes the Donkey because he&#8217;s got big hairy ears, just like Uncle Gus.  Who&#8217;s Uncle Gus all of a sudden?  Some distant relative that they&#8217;ll only ever mention one time for the sake of a throwaway joke, I guess.  Danny insists that they return the donkey and then Kimmie Gibbler informs him that the petting zoo that they bought him from was a traveling petting zoo that was packing up to leave for Seattle immediately after their purchase and, even though that couldn&#8217;t have been more than like 10 minutes ago, for story purposes we’ll all just assume that they&#8217;re long gone.  Danny&#8217;s like, &#8220;well, fuck,&#8221; and agrees to let the donkey stay in the backyard overnight while they figure out what to do with him.  He tells Michelle that she&#8217;ll have to clean up after the donkey and she says, &#8220;no problem, I already clean up after my hamster.&#8221;  Wait&#8230; she has a hamster?  Since when?  I never saw no hamster.  Where does she keep it?  Maybe it stays with Uncle Gus.</p>
<p>The donkey starts braying loudly in the backyard in the middle of the night, pissing off the neighbors and waking up the denizens of the full house.  DJ is concerned that if the donkey keeps her up all night, her school picture wont turn out well.  Everyone else&#8217;s concerns are less specific but they all want the donkey to shut the fuck up, except for Michelle, who seems to love the donkey unconditionally and want to keep him, probably just to spite everyone else.  The twins come downstairs and ask Jesse to sing the 3&#8217;s Company theme song again and then when he refuses, Joey coerces him by suggesting that it will drown out the loud braying of &#8220;Engelbert Donkeydink&#8221; which is maybe the most baffling wordplay I&#8217;ve ever heard in my life.  It&#8217;s neither a timely reference nor a clever pun.  What the fuck?  Anyway, Jesse sings the theme song to the twins and then everyone notices that the donkey stopped making noises while he was singing so, naturally, the only solution to the problem at hand is for Jesse to stay up all night and sing the 3&#8217;s Company theme to the donkey over and over. Again, if nothing else, points for originality here.  Maybe &#8220;Engelbert Donkeydink&#8221; wasn&#8217;t very inspired but whoever wrote this plot synopsis was on some shit.</p>

<p>Becky suggests that they give the donkey to the children’s zoo and everyone agrees that it’s a good idea, even Michelle, who’s finally willing to recognize what a piece of shit her donkey is.  She says that she’s gonna buy everyone some candy and then put the rest of the money in the bank after they sell the donkey but then Jesse explains to her that they’re going to have to donate him because he’s fucking useless and she was a total moron to waste all of her money on him in the first place.</p>
