Danny walks into the kitchen and sees them, which is pretty unavoidable because they&#8217;re in a totally conspicuous place, and he decides for some reason that he has to hide behind the kitchen counter so they don&#8217;t see him.</p>

<p>As they prepare to travel to their upcoming gig, the Monkey Puppets lament their roadie unexpectedly quitting and decide to dupe Joey into doing the job for free by asking him to open for their performance with his shitty stand-up comedy act.</p>
<p>Everyone helps Becky carry her and the twins’ luggage to the car because they’re going on the road with Jesse for some reason.  After they all exit the scene, Viper comes into the kitchen and starts smoochin’ all up on DJ again.  He tries to persuade her to come to the gig and to tell her dad about them but she insists that Danny will object on account of his shabby attire and big fake tattoo.</p>

<p>DJ tells Danny that she’s going to go see Jesse’s band with Kimmie Gibbler and he tells her that there’s no way that she’s going because he knows all about her personal business.  She asks him why the fuck she was spying on her and for some reason he doesn’t clarify that he only knows because she was smooching in front of a big window and all he was doing was standing in the kitchen.  Danny tells DJ that he doesn’t trust Viper because, unlike Steve, he’s not really the kind of guy who will wait 18 months to get to second base and then DJ tells him that he can go suck a dick because she’s gonna go anyway and he can’t stop her.</p>
<p>As Becky entertains the twins with the vibrating bed, Jesse brings back a bunch of crap from the vending machine for dinner, like a true hunter gatherer.  Joey and Viper come in to scheme on the snacks and then Jesse admits that the hotel is a big shithole, which leads to an existential crisis about him getting older.</p>

<p>The club owner comes over and starts demanding that the band gets ready to perform some polka and Jesse’s like, “what the fuck are you even talking about?”  Once the situation is clarified, Jesse tells him that they’re not equipped for polka but then the owner tells him that he’s got a “roomful of polka supplies.”  Sure, why not?  Before Jesse can explain that they’re not a polka band and are totally unqualified to play that kind of music, Viper intervenes and shares that he was raised in a polka band.  Ok, so that’s one guy who can play polka… how’s the rest of the band supposed to learn how to do it now?  Why are they even humoring this scenario?  I doubt that this gig pays jack shit.</p>
<p>Jesse is so moved by Viper’s offer to help him play a gig that he should clearly walk out on that he apologizes for objecting to their relationship and invites him back into the band.  As Jesse and his band head to the back room to prepare to humiliate themselves even more than they would have if they’d played their own music, Danny comes in with the girls.  DJ takes him aside and explains that she’s almost 18 years old and he can’t dictate who she can and can’t date.  The music comes on (for the first time in like 4 episodes!  I kind of hoped that it was never coming back but I guess that was a pretty unrealistic aspiration.  Maybe it was missing from those last episodes because they had such nonsensical premises’, whereas this one has a much clearer very special message.  Or, more likely, no one cared enough to remember to include it) as DJ explains that there’s nothing to worry about because she’s pretty obviously one of those wait-for-marriage chicks and then Danny says that he trusts her judgment, and then, hugs.</p>
<p>Jesse and his band come out in their lederhosen and I guess we’re supposed to believe that they can perform polka after all.  Hey, why not?  For a second I thought that the whole relationship premise was going to be nullified when DJ sees Viper in that ridiculous little polka outfit, because if that’s not a deal breaker then I don’t know what is, but for some reason she seems pretty into it.</p>

Well, they were wrong.</p>
