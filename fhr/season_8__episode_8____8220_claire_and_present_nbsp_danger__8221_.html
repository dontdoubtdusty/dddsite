<p>Stephanie plays some weird table hockey-esque game on the coffee table with Michele until Gia shows up at the full house, at which point Stephanie totally ditches her ugly little sister.</p>

<p>After Jesse takes his rant to the other room, DJ and Viper read the article on the couch together and then she asks him if he&#8217;s done before turning the page.  Even though that&#8217;s basically just a casual display of decent manners (a rarity in the full house), Viper gets all butthurt because he takes it as an implication that she thinks he&#8217;s a slow reader.  I kept expecting this to turn into a very special episode in which we discover that Viper can&#8217;t read (that was totally a thing in the 90&#8217;s.  Jordan Catalano couldn&#8217;t read, Blossom&#8217;s boyfriend was dyslexic or something and Mallory Keaton&#8217;s boyfriend was a complete fucking moron.  I don&#8217;t know why smart young women having learning impaired rebel boyfriends was such a hot trend back then) but it&#8217;s really just a forced argument to try to make their relationship somewhat interesting.  Hey, I just noticed that like every single romantic relationship ever on this show is completely defined by the arguments that occur within it.  Jesse and Becky&#8217;s relationship is like that, and so was DJ and Steve&#8217;s.  It&#8217;s like if they&#8217;re not having some totally absurd argument about something trivial then there&#8217;s nothing going on in the relationship at all.  What&#8217;s up with that?  Anyway, Viper gets all irate and accuses her of thinking that she&#8217;s better than him because she&#8217;s going to go to college and then he storms off like a big fucking baby.</p>

<p>The next morning, Michelle tries to include herself in the conversation once again as Stephanie and Gia discuss what they&#8217;re going to wear to Jessie&#8217;s terrible show at the Smash Club.  Gia routinely refers to Michelle as &#8220;Little Michelle,&#8221; which seems really forced and unnatural to me.  Also, and I fully recognize that I&#8217;m a bad person who should go to jail for pointing this out, but, good lord, Gia&#8217;s got some straight up jugs!</p>

<p>Gia and Stephanie arrive at the Smash Club with Michelle, who walks off with a bag that contains something mysterious.  Joey comes in with a beret on while speaking with a mock-French accent and I have to say that, this far into the series, I&#8217;m amazed that he still somehow manages to find ways to make me hate him even more.  I really hate Joey, you guys.  He asks Becky if she&#8217;s seen the french chick that he was talking about during the pre-credits gag and she says that she hasn&#8217;t.  That&#8217;s pretty odd that this sub-plot was started in the pre-credits gag.  I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s ever happened before.</p>

<p>Viper takes DJ aside and apologizes by showing her a gigantic shirt that he&#8217;s purchased that says, &#8220;I&#8217;m with stupid.&#8221;  Who&#8217;s that shirt for?  Is DJ supposed to wear it?  It would be like a muumuu on her.  Even if it&#8217;s for Viper, it&#8217;s too damn big.  Seriously, that shirt&#8217;s fucking enormous.  Why&#8217;d they use such a big shirt?  It&#8217;s really distracting.</p>

<p>Jesse finds Viper moping offstage and tells him to hurry up and get his shit together so they can proceed with their terrible performance.  Viper tells Jesse that he followed his nonsensical advice and it blew up in his face and now he’s too sad to play a bunch of crappy covers of outdated songs.  Motivated entirely by self-preservation, Jesse forces DJ to talk with Viper and shares a bunch of confusing metaphors with them about flowers and hailstorms that somehow prompts them to make up.  Having inexplicably succeeded in resolving their conflict in a matter of a few seconds, Jesse rounds up Viper so they can start the show.</p>
