<p>As Gia and Stephanie enjoy a pleasant afternoon at the mall food court, Gia orders Stephanie to &#8220;check out those guys&#8221; and then, after the camera pans over to them, I could only conclude that she said it because she couldn&#8217;t believe what a couple of enormous dipshits they were.</p>

<p>DJ and Kimmie Gibbler roll up on the scene and almost fuck up the whole charade but then Stephanie pulls them aside and begs them to go along with their front.  DJ and Kimmie Gibbler are like, &#8220;sure, who gives a shit?&#8221; and then they split.  Stephanie goes back to the table and discovers that the boys have left but Gia informs her that they went to go get their car so they could give them a ride home.  Stephanie is hesitant to get into a car with some buffoonish looking boys that she doesn&#8217;t even know but then Gia&#8217;s like, &#8220;I am your token irresponsible friend and I&#8217;m always going to pressure you to do stupid shit in order for you to learn a valuable lesson so let&#8217;s just cut to the fucking chase already.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jesse continues to monopolize Michelle&#8217;s video game while she sits on the couch rolling her eyes.  Joey comes in and becomes engaged with the activity, followed by Danny and Becky, all of whom grow hopelessly enthralled within seconds.</p>

<p>Stephanie comes home and tells DJ about all the stupid irresponsible nonsense that she just participated in as though it&#8217;s a real cool story and DJ&#8217;s like, &#8220;bitch, have you lost your mind?&#8221;  Stephanie tells her to fuck off and quit raining on her parade and DJ&#8217;s like, &#8220;fine, whatever.&#8221;</p>
<p>DJ interrupts the adults&#8217; obsessive video game affair to tell them that it&#8217;s time for dinner, which she apparently prepared herself.  It&#8217;s weird how she&#8217;s like the responsible matron of the full house all of a sudden.  Everyone eats hastily (even the dog for some reason) so they can get back to their video game and then they all rush off, leaving DJ to do the dishes.</p>
<p>The second that everyone leaves, Gia comes in (never mind that if they hadn&#8217;t finished dinner unusually quickly, she would be walking right into the middle of it) and tells Stephanie that their new crazy driver boyfriends are outside and want to take them out for more potentially fatal hijinks.  Stephanie goes into the living room to ask Danny for permission to go out and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;do whatever the fuck you want.  I&#8217;m totally obsessed with this video game right now.&#8221;  It seems like there&#8217;s some sort of hidden moral in this episode about how playing video games makes you a negligent parent or something but I&#8217;m probably just putting more thought into it than any of the writers did.</p>
<p>DJ intervenes, telling Stephanie that there&#8217;s no way that she&#8217;s going to let her get into that stunt car again and that she&#8217;ll narc on her to Danny if she tries to go.  They have a stand-off where Stephanie makes her way towards the door and DJ moves closer to the living room where Danny is and in the end DJ&#8217;s willingness to be a snitch overpowers Stephanie&#8217;s urge for teenage rebellion.  Stephanie tells Gia that she can&#8217;t go and then stomps off up to her room, hella mad.</p>

<p>DJ goes into Stephanie&#8217;s room to have a very special talk and Stephanie&#8217;s like, &#8220;kiss my ass, you meddling poindexter.&#8221;  They start bickering until Danny comes into the room and tells Stephanie that Gia&#8217;s mom (who he&#8217;s totally been stickin&#8217; it to) called to tell him that Gia was in a car accident.  He asks if she was supposed to be in the car, too, and DJ tells him that Stephanie decided not to go because the boys were irresponsible drivers.  Danny tells Stephanie that he&#8217;s proud of her for having such good judgement and then hugs her before abruptly leaving the scene.</p>
<p>Stephanie apologizes to DJ because she&#8217;s been such a stupid asshole and then DJ tell her about how she and Kimmie Gibbler stayed out all night on Halloween when they were 13 because they were once stupid assholes, too.  The music comes on as DJ tells Stephanie that she&#8217;ll eventually acquire a better meter for when something&#8217;s a bad idea and then they hug.  Stephanie then tells DJ that she feels like a piece of shit for lying to Danny about why she didn&#8217;t get into the car with those boys and decides that she&#8217;d better tell him, which is kind of great because it&#8217;s totally going to get DJ in trouble because she&#8217;s the one who lied to him.  Take that, DJ!</p>
