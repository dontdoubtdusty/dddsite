                <div class="event-description">Approximately 200 horses materialize at high altitude and plummet from completely clear skies across six continents. They fall from heights between 500-2000 feet with no warning or explanation. The survival rate is zero—every horse dies on impact. Initial eyewitness reports are dismissed as elaborate hoaxes or mass hallucinations by authorities desperately seeking rational explanations.</div>

                <div class="event-description">A full-grown stallion crashes through the reinforced glass ceiling of a shopping mall in Jakarta during peak shopping hours, killing 3 people instantly and injuring 17 others with debris and trauma. High-quality smartphone footage from multiple angles goes viral within hours. Similar documented incidents in Phoenix, Manchester, and São Paulo within the same 24-hour period confirm this is a global phenomenon. Scientists convene emergency panels but have no working hypothesis.</div>

                <div class="event-title">Global Emergency</div>
                <div class="event-description">Emergency protocols activate in 147 countries. Governments issue mandatory "stay indoors" warnings during daylight hours when falls appear most frequent. All outdoor gatherings—concerts, sports, markets, protests—are banned indefinitely. The phrase "horse weather" enters common usage as a darkly ironic term for any daytime hours. Insurance companies begin catastrophic failures as they're overwhelmed with claims. Air travel is grounded except for essential flights at dangerous low altitudes.</div>

                <div class="event-description">Data scientists identify disturbing patterns: approximately 60% of horse falls occur over populated areas rather than wilderness or ocean, and 85% happen between 6 AM and 8 PM. However, no predictive model succeeds—the exact timing and location remain completely random. This unpredictability is psychologically devastating. A new diagnosis emerges in psychiatric literature: Equinophobia from Above (EFA), characterized by panic attacks when exposed to open sky.</div>

                <div class="event-description">A worldwide industrial mobilization begins, compared in scale to WWII-era production. Governments mandate structural reinforcements for all buildings and public spaces. Engineers work around the clock designing "sky shields"—reinforced canopies and covered walkways. Japan leads innovation with articulated shield systems. Unemployment drops to near-zero as construction labor demand explodes. Parks, playgrounds, and open spaces become mass graveyards, littered with horse carcasses. Children haven't played outside in weeks. The psychological toll is immeasurable.</div>

                <div class="event-description">Several small towns and rural communities are essentially abandoned after repeated strikes make habitation impossible. "Dead zones" emerge—areas hit so frequently that no amount of reinforcement feels adequate. Outdoor life has completely ended in most of the world. The livestock industry faces existential crisis as cattle, sheep, and existing horses must be relocated to expensive indoor facilities. Food prices spike catastrophically. Religious movements explode—some preaching divine punishment, others that this proves cosmic meaninglessness. The "Church of the Descending Equine" claims 2 million followers.</div>

                <div class="event-description">Dubai completes the world's first fully-enclosed city district—a 2-square-mile area covered by an articulated titanium-reinforced canopy system designed to flex and absorb impacts from falling horses. The engineering marvel costs $89 billion and becomes the model for wealthy nations. Schools begin reopening with mandatory reinforced ceilings rated for multi-ton impacts. A generation of children develops who have never known outdoor recess and view the sky as inherently hostile.</div>

                <div class="event-description">During a rare outdoor presidential movement, a horse falls directly onto the armored motorcade carrying Air Force One's ground convoy. The US President survives with severe spinal injuries but is permanently disabled. Vice Presidential succession occurs within 48 hours. This becomes the defining symbolic moment when the entire world accepts that nowhere—regardless of security measures, wealth, or power—is truly safe from the horse rain. Even the most protected individuals on Earth are vulnerable.</div>

                <div class="event-description">The "Canopy Wars" erupt as stark class divisions become literally visible from space. Wealthy neighborhoods install comprehensive private canopy systems with reinforced materials and impact-absorbing technology. Poor neighborhoods remain completely exposed to the sky. Protests demanding "Sky Justice" and equal protection turn violent in major cities. Governments struggle to provide universal coverage while economies collapse. The "Equine Disposal Crisis" reaches critical mass—specialized "Sky Sweeper" teams in armored vehicles work 24/7 shifts to clear hundreds of thousands of decomposing horse carcasses.</div>

                <div class="event-description">An entire generation of children is growing up who have never known the freedom of safe outdoor play. "Outside" is synonymous with death in their developing minds. Psychological studies document unprecedented rates of agoraphobia, depression, and profound disconnection from nature. Birth rates plummet globally as people question bringing children into this world. Meanwhile, science admits complete defeat—horses appear to materialize at altitude, showing no radiation, no dimensional tears, nothing. Quantum physicists, biologists, and religious scholars all propose theories, but none can be tested or proven.</div>
